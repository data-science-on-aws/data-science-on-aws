You use the flow definition to configure your human workforce and provide information about how to accomplish the human review task. You can create a flow definition in the Amazon Augmented AI console or with Amazon A2I APIs. To learn more about both of these options, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-create-flow-definition.html\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **human loop** to start your human review workflow. When you use one of the built-in task types, the corresponding AWS service creates and starts a human loop on your behalf when the conditions specified in your flow definition are met or for each object if no conditions were specified. When a human loop is triggered, human review tasks are sent to the workers as specified in the flow definition.\n",
