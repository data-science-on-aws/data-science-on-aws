    "# Multi-Armed Bandits and Reinforcement Learning with Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate how you can manage your own contextual multi-armed bandit workflow on SageMaker using the built-in [AWS Reinforcement Learning Container](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-rl-container) container to train and deploy contextual bandit models. We show how to train these models that interact with a live environment (using a simulated client application) and continuously update the model with efficient exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Contextual Bandits?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wherever we look to personalize content for a user (content layout, ads, search, product recommendations, etc.), contextual bandits come in handy. Traditional personalization methods collect a training dataset, build a model and deploy it for generating recommendations. However, the training algorithm does not inform us on how to collect this dataset, especially in a production system where generating poor recommendations lead to loss of revenue. Contextual bandit algorithms help us collect this data in a strategic manner by trading off between exploiting known information and exploring recommendations which may yield higher benefits. The collected data is used to update the personalization model in an online manner. Therefore, contextual bandits help us train a personalization model while minimizing the impact of poor recommendations."

    "To implement the exploration-exploitation strategy, we need an iterative training and deployment system that: (1) recommends an action using the contextual bandit model based on user context, (2) captures the implicit feedback over time and (3) continuously trains the model with incremental interaction data. In this notebook, we show how to setup the infrastructure needed for such an iterative learning system. While the example demonstrates a bandits application, these continual learning systems are useful more generally in dynamic scenarios where models need to be continually updated to capture the recent trends in the data (e.g. tracking fraud behaviors based on detection mechanisms or tracking user interests over time). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical supervised learning setup, the model is trained with a SageMaker training job and it is hosted behind a SageMaker hosting endpoint. The client application calls the endpoint for inference and receives a response. In bandits, the client application also sends the reward (a score assigned to each recommendation generated by the model) back for subsequent model training. These rewards will be part of the dataset for the subsequent model training. "

    "The bandit model is implemented by the open source [**Bandit Experiment Manager**](./common/sagemaker_rl/orchestrator/workflow/manager/) provided with this example.  This This implementation continuously updates a Vowpal Wabbit reinforcement learning model using Amazon SageMaker, DynamoDB, Kinesis, and S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client application, a recommender system with a review service in our case, pings the SageMaker hosting endpoint that is serving the bandit model.  The application sends the an `event` with the `context` (ie. user, product, and review text) to the bandit model and receives a recommended action from the bandit model.  In our case, the action is 1 of 2 BERT models that we are testing.  The bandit model stores this event data (given context and recommended action) in S3 using Amazon Kinesis.  _Note:  The context makes this a \"contextual bandit\" and differentiates this implementation from a regular multi-armed bandit._\n",
    "\n",
    "The client application uses the recommended BERT model to classify the review text as star rating 1 through 5 and  compares the predicted star rating to the user-selected star rating.  If the BERT model correctly predicts the star rating of the review text (ie. matches the user-selected star rating), then the bandit model is rewarded with `reward=1`.  If the BERT model incorrectly classifies the star rating of the review text, the bandit model is not rewarded (`reward=0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The client application stores the rewards data in S3 using Amazon Kinesis.  Periodically (ie. every 100 rewards), we incrementally train an updated bandit model with the latest the reward and event data.  This updated bandit model is evaluated against the current model using a holdout dataset of rewards and events.  If the bandit model accuracy is above a given threshold relative to the existing model, it is automatically deployed in a blue/green manner with no downtime.  SageMaker RL supports offline evaluation by performing counterfactual analysis (CFA).  By default, we apply [**doubly robust (DR) estimation**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.4601.pdf) method. The bandit model tries to minimize the cost (`1 - reward`), so a smaller evaluation score indicates better bandit model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional A/B tests, the bandit model will learn the best BERT model (action) for a given context over time and begin to shift traffic to the best model.  Depending on the aggressiveness of the bandit model algorithm selected, the bandit model will continuously explore the under-performing models, but start to favor and exploit the over-performing models.  And unlike A/B tests, multi-armed bandits allow you to add a new action (ie. BERT model) dynamically throughout the life of the experiment.  When the bandit model sees the new BERT model, it will start sending traffic and exploring the accuracy of the new BERT model - alongside the existing BERT models in the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate experimentation, we provide a `local_mode` that runs the contextual bandit example using the SageMaker Notebook instance itself instead of the SageMaker training and hosting cluster instances.  The workflow remains the same in `local_mode`, but runs much faster for small datasets.  Hence, it is a useful tool for experimenting and debugging.  However, it will not scale to production use cases with high throughput and large datasets.  In `local_mode`, the training, evaluation, and hosting is done in the local [SageMaker Vowpal Wabbit Docker Container](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-rl-container)."
