"This movie isn't perfect, but it gets a lot of things right. Yes, the librarian character played by Marcia Gay Harden is stereotypical and played a bit heavy-handed. But the universal nature of the story, the beautiful setting, and the likability of the characters overcome this flaw. The quote at the end brought tears to my eyes.  If you want to take a break from Hollywood's standard fare of dark, violent, or stupid movies, then give this a try. It is is entertaining and thoughtful.",4,True

"If you know Albert Brooks, you know his comedy is dry.  It's not for everyone, but I get a kick out of him.  Debbie Reynolds absolutely makes this movie an enjoyable way to spend an hour and 44 minutes of your time.  It's slow to start but stick with it because once Miss Reynolds hits the screen, it becomes a truly wonderful film with lots of laughable moments...especially if you have older parents who struggle with technology, or acquire quirky habits like freezing every form of food under the sun.  I waited and waited for this film to become available on Amazon Prime but it never showed up.  So I finally bought a digital copy to keep in my collection and am so happy I did.",5,True
"While watching the trailer for this film it states that this is a documentary about a mans journey visiting Jamaica, once you rent the film it gives a small history of what you are about to see.  At this time it states that the film maker decided this material was to spiritual to share and he decided to put all of the content on the shelf.  Only about ten minutes of the film is with someone interviewing people about the haunted history of the island and the rest of the film is merely advertising another film project.",1,False
"This movie was so cute. The perfect movie for movie night with my 11 year old son.

"Science fiction often asks us to examine worlds different from the one we know. It asks 'if then'? What if socialists win elections across the globe? What if Donald Trump wins in 2016, and is such an amazing leader, him and his brand of leadership serve as a guide for our nation, or perhaps the world, for generations to come? Just as often as it asks, 'if then', it asks, 'what if'? What if energy becomes completely free? What if cloning humans becomes as prevalent a trip to the local doctor? Many might recognize Sci Fi in it's creation of imaginary worlds that ask us to look upon our own world right now, presented in a different perspective, sometimes criticizing current society, or instead, some members in it.<br /><br />There were early or proto 'sci-fi' stories written as long ago as 2,000 years ago but it's been said science fiction as we know it didn't really (and couldn't really) exist until the 1900's when we became more aware of the larger world around us. It's a menace, a threat, a disease, or an ideology that threatens us all. After watching Battleship, I can't help but wonder if characters in the story have to save the whole world in order for it to Science fiction.<br /><br />Do the characters in Battleship save the world? With the speed in which aliens send five space ships to Earth after receiving a radio message from Earth, covering at bare minimum 10 light years distance, and their amazing ability to put up an energy shield covering all of Hawaii and a larger portion of ocean, it is a real question as to whether or not they'd send even more ships? The mystery of their other ships disappearance might mean something to them. Perhaps, though, for whatever reason, our navies did save the Earth.<br /><br />There's some question throughout the film whether or not the aliens are truly hostile, or whether they are merely trying to protect themselves and their mission as the film unwinds (although admittedly over reacting to us Earthlings - or did they under react to the threat we pose)?Quite often they let Earthlings go or be on their way if they do not consider them a threat. Are they going to eliminate or subjugate them later? Who knows, but why take any chances? One of the more interesting scenes in the film is shown from the perspective of one of the alien soldiers. It seems to be a memory or a flashback. We see him and his race at war with and being attacked by another alien race.<br /><br />The escalation to war, or at least fighting, is held out to be a metaphor for a fight between an American navy captain (the lead in the film) and his Korean rival. Our navy captain is punished quite severely for participating in the fight. It's an open question in the mind of the viewer through much of the film - is he being punished so hard because his opponent is Korean, or Asian? Throughout the film, especially the later parts, I couldn't help but see pop singer Rihanna, the female lead, in the role of mate to many of the different male characters (especially the extra pale guy with the buzz cut that often behaved kind of stupidly). The 'shells' being loaded and fired became quite interesting. I don't know what it was. It was a very intense movie. We can always hope they achieve contact. Battleship couldn't have been made without an interracial cast. Or at least it wouldn't have been as interesting - having only the action on screen to interest us.<br /><br />Overall it was a very entertaining film. Overall the plot made a lot of sense. Our victory over much more powerful aliens made a bit less sense. There were some breaks in the action, or explanations that went missing in the film (at what point did night fall and the Aliens somehow lose track of them)?  Battleship may have been cut or reduced in length. If so the film suffered a little bit because of it. Over all the film makes more sense if you consider that the aliens might not be completely hostile, or again, if they don't see us as much of an immediate threat to their selfish plans.<br /><br />One thing is certain, never send out a signal to another planet deep in space we know nothing about in order to contact them. There, I just saved the world.nd out a signal to another planet deep in space we know nothing about in order to contact them. There, I just saved the world.",4,True

"This show is utterly ridiculous. Granted, the book upon which it is based has some pretty crazy stuff in it, but the show has gone off the rails and completely misses the point of the book. The novel, by the great Stephen King shares a lot of DNA with the Twilight Zone classic episode &#34;The Monsters are Due on Maple Street.&#34; In both, aliens mess with a slice of pure Americana (a suburban street, a small New England town), but don't really do much. They have an agenda, but they're very hands off in their methods. The point of each is that we don't need to worry about some alien menace. Under the right conditions, we become worse monsters than any extraterrestrial ones.<br /><br />That may have been the focus in the first season, but since then the show has gone into a crazy Invasion of the Body Snatchers Lite direction. It's pretty terrible.",1,False
"Great movie. It's a blatant metaphor for the US/Mexican border and immigration issue, which probably accounts for it's less than amazing critic scores. This film has a heavy liberal bias, and I say that as a liberal myself. If you are strongly conservative and unable to separate your politics from your film-going experience, then this may not be your kind of film. If you could watch Avatar and still sympathize with the protagonists I think you'll be okay, but this issue strikes closer to home for some.

"The best of the Stargate series, in my opinion. It has a cast led by the amazing and well-chose Robert Carlyle, who pulls the rest of the actors up several levels in their performances.<br />The scripts are more adult and more realistic than the average potboiler, too - simple survival requires much intelligence when faced with almost incomprehensible technology and the terrifying hostile environment of deep space. No easy answers. Every scrap of knowledge requires a step into the unknown. And they don't even know where they are in the universe, let alone how to get home.<br />It's a huge, rich canvas for this skilled creative team. So why did it end early? Not because of flaws in the performances or production structure. It was due to SyFy's usual crappy promotion, and so the series ended long before it was out of story-telling potency.<br />Enjoy what's here. Eli is our Everyman.",5,True

The movie took out the most important parts skipping through what I thought was the whole reason behind the book which was to show how that certain faction was able to maintain its hippy type of go with the flow earthy behavior was because they were being drugged the whole time through the special tea ...... this came to light only after Tris was given the same tea and not being used to it, it had a over drugging loopy effect in her.

"Nice movie about two gay brothers who have taken different paths in life and how they have come back together after years apart. Johnny Hazzard plays one brother who is outspoken, a major flirt, and a party type guy who does what he wants when he wants and to whomever. He is easy on the eyes and makes no bones about his sexuality. Mark Strano plays the other brother he is a homebody who has stayed in the family home and continued to run the family business. He is not the social butterfly, more protected and straight acting.  The two brothers find themselves back together as the fancy free brother is broke and homeless and needs somewhere to land and the more put together brother needs to open up himself more and be true to who he is.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully made movie about family and friendship, love and longing and the ghosts from the past. An an actor Johnny Hazzard has improved so much from his past roles in cheesy porn like soap operas such as The Lair, and knew to me at least Mark Strano could not have played a better character that many people can identify with.<br />Highly recommend this movie.",4,True

"Five stars is not enough. Ali was the greatest both inside and outside of the ring. All Americans, and anyone anywhere that hold that freedom and human rights must be universal, should see this video. Ali was a moral giant with a stalwart internalized sense of right and wrong.

He was willing to risk all of the fame and fortune that he had miraculously achieved, to suffer being barred from his profession forever if necessary, and even to go to jail. He intended to follow his spiritual/moral core beliefs no matter what. He did so and he paid dearly.

I would have preferred a little more build up, so not only so we (the audience) could get to know them a little (and relate to them all more), but so they could get to know each other better too; making their interactions more believable.  Another minor problem I had was that the main character (warning minor spoiler) seemed to be very much a spectator in his own life.  This was quite evident in by him being illiterate even after being over 100 years old.  Except for being able to throw a baseball well, and having an encyclopedic knowledge about the sport, he seemed to have picked up no other skills, no wisdom, no charm, etc...

"Classic film. A great example of an extinct style of animation: Rotoscope. Watch with context. This film was way ahead of its time. The movie paved the way for many films, including Peter Jacksons LOTR trilogy. Jackson will never admit it, but he used many of Bakshis scenes to block out his camera and action for the live action trilogy.<br />Too bad Bakshi ran out of money. The movie ends in the middle of the triloigy, and very abruptly. Still fun to watch.",4,True

It is a good depiction of Augustus' rise to power and interesting relationship he had with his daughter Julia whom later would be exiled to Pontus.

The Allies forced the local townspeople that lived near the camps to walk through the camps to see the atrocities committed by their government.  These people walked in smiling; different story on the way out.  Some fainted, some got sick and the rest were absolutely horrified seeing the piles of corpses, starving people near death and even furniture made of human skin!  This is a must watch for those that are holocaust deniers.",4,True

"I was pleasantly surprised at this series. It is not sensationalized speculation about aliens or conspiracies. Rather, each episode takes a subject and walks you through what happens to it in the museum, behind the scenes. There is a little getting-to-know the people there but its not a reality television thing at all. I think there is something for everyone here, as this is not a subject that is covered much. Not sure if this was/is PBS but it could almost be. Oh and if you want to relax this is great. No excitement but interesting enough that it will not put you to sleep.",4,True

"Here's another &#34;oldie-goldie&#34; that leaves you lingering in thought of those character traits that inspire rather than discourage.  People of noble-character demonstrating: civility even in rebellion, dignity vs uncouth, selfless love despite loss, and generosity over personal gain to help foreigners attain better lives.  These types of movies promote the best in humans .... something to aspire to.  It left you pondering the good in people.  I liked it",5,True
"So this film definitely isn't for everybody, but if you're tired of formulaic hollywood &#34;indie&#34; films and want something dry, weird, and lo-fi, this is solid gold. It's funny in a dark, deadpan way, with a nihilistic vibe and a little bit of violence. Overall, this is the most original indie film I've seen in several years.",4,True
"DO NOT BE DECEIVED. THIS IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE. 90% of the film consisted of an expressionless Ryan Gosling gazing at....stuff. As for his other scenes, I envision a scenario in which the director instructed Gosling to express the absolute least amount of emotion possible in every single scene. It appears to be a film meant to impress people who make films rather than for people who enjoy them. Watching this film was PAINFULLY, PAINFULLY BORING. That this film is boring cannot be emphasized enough.",1,False

"EARLY PLOT SPOILER<br /><br />The best way to watch this film is cold, having read no reviews including this one. Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34; Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?",3,True

"This was a disappointing movie.  The actor playing the maid was attractive and sympathetic but the crucial moment in her relationship with the young boy was very unconvincing, whether it was the fault of the direction or the script, I am not sure.  The young lead actor was just bad.  Again, it may have been the fault of the script but he was very unsympathetic.  It was very hard to see what the maid could possibly see in such a obnoxious teen-ager.",2,True
"I loved this movie!  I thought the character development was great, and it kept me totally entertained.",5,True
"Still a very interesting series, but changes to the cast and some of the story lines diminish the strength of the series.",4,True

"Dynamite period piece layered with more than corsets and crinolines. Issues of race, family relationships, the position/s of women, and legalities verses moral integrities in the 18th century unfold organically and are confronted by authentic textured characters who are based in fact.<br />Society and historical context are displayed within the confines of a tightly written script, beautifully realized by artistic technical collaboration, headed by a director of imaginative vision, passionate loving heart, and a deft guiiding hand.<br />What's portrayed in this film is only one of the specific worlds that benefited and thrived during the long world history of black enslavement. It is a pretty world, for those on top of course, and we are not really shown &#34;slavery&#34; as experienced in another recent film dealing with a similar theme, Twelve Years A Slave. The sweep of Belle offers the audience a different tone, wider issues.  It's view of slavery is just as horrific as slavery is in Twelve Years A Slave, but its particular and also very specific points are made in quieter ways--at least for this viewer.<br />Both films hit home and are most satisfying, in their own good and different ways.<br />It's great to see a black woman leading a period piece, too.<br />Belle is a beautiful film and is one that I will watch again.",5,True
"The cast seemed way too old to me. Why are all of these 30-year-olds still in high school? Aside from that, it was a touchy-feely film that tried way too hard to relate to today's high school students. The moral of the story is that you'll always be better off just being a nice person. The message was too simple to justify a 45 minute story. A younger audience might not see the flaws and be entertained by the premise.",2,False

"Hayden Christensen plays a total jerk who wakes up one day to find that nearly everyone in the world has vanished, and the days grow shorter and the nights increasingly longer. Worse yet, the shadows are alive and are trying kill everyone. On paper, Vanishing on 7th Street sounds like a sure fire win for a horror movie. It plays on the natural fear of the dark many people have, has plenty of mystery that keeps you engaged, and it has a fairly solid cast with the likes of Christensen (who shouldn't be judged by the poor script he had in the Star Wars prequels), Thandie Newton, and John Leguizamo.<br /><br />Sadly, while the film does have some decent scares and manages to maintain some level of tension. It never fully achieves the potential it sets itself up for. Between hokey CGI shadow effects, hackneyed usage of true historical mysteries with easy explanations that blow the film's supposed explanation out of the water, and truly stupid character decisions the film feels more like a bad Doctor Who episode (and given that show actually had an episode about killer shadows that was AMAZING makes this film look all the more worse). Add onto that, a truly stupid ending with obvious biblical undertones and a shot that rips off the iconic image of The Walking Dead's Rick Grimes riding his horse down an abandoned highway and you have the mediocre strawberry on a truly disappointing cake.<br /><br />Not to mention, it's way too easy to make &#34;Dark side of the force&#34; jokes throughout the entire film's run time. I strongly recommend watching this movie with your friends and seeing who can come up with the best Dark Side pun.",3,True

"I thought this movie would be similar in plot to the movie ' Set-Up ' starring Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah. Not even close! it was straight-up nonsense!

"This film has non-stop exciting action and all sorts of improbable but enjoyable situations. I felt that one regular cast member who has grown along with the rest of the cast as the series has evolved was dispensed with too readily, but otherwise a great film, outstanding cast, excellent cinematography and direction. This will definitely please fans of the Fast and Furious franchise and the hot rod, speed movie genre. This film has lots of fun and excitement and is OK for families with older kids to watch. There is no profanity that I can recall but lots of violence, although it has an ethereal quality. This is the most durable, bulletproof family of hot-rodders you will ever meet. Spellbinding special effects and touching tribute to the late Paul Walker, a talented artist who left us much too soon. Filmmaking gold.",5,True

This is an excellent history on tuberculosis.  I had no idea it was so widespread at one time.  This explains why and when so many sanatoriums were built around the world and in the US.

"Why do war movies get everything wrong? This is supposed to be about the battle for the Kall Trail, part of the horrendous Battle of the Huertgen Forest in 1944. That was a very interesting, bloody conflict. However, in the movie, the terrain is all wrong (the Kall trail is a steep trail down into a deep ravine where it crosses a little stream before rising back up a steep trail--in the movie it looks like the Rio Grande), the tactics are from the trenches of WWI, not WWII (the soldiers all stand up together and slowly walk on line to get slaughtered), and the weapons are ridiculous (the German 88 and tanks are direct fire weapons, not artillery).<br />Not sure how making this movie with just a tiny bit of historical accuracy would have been so difficult. Is it because the writers/producers/directors are stupid, or because they are lazy, or because they actually do want to portray the past incorrectly?",2,False
Very engaging.,4,True

I think the series is successful in showing how our lives and the way we live it could lead people to committing crimes or being victims as well.<br /><br />I watch an episode on a daily basis and I'm already thinking of what will happen when I watch the last episode, I guess I'll miss it as you miss an old friend.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",5,True

The &#34;swervy&#34; conclusion, unfortunately, does not justify the hour or so investment getting there.

"After reading the Hiaasen book (Strip Tease), I was curious about the movie version of the story. While I believe that any movie version cannot reflect favorably all of the background and details of its book form, this movie, in particular did not weave the plot together seamlessly (coherently). If you are not seduced by the visions of the lovely topless Demi Moore, or the Burt Reynold's whacky interpretation of Congressman Dave Dilbeck, you will not find this film compelling. I really think this is about a 2.5.",3,True

"I was very disappointed in this movie. I haven't read the book, but I sure hope it's better than the movie was. Judy Blume has an excellent reputation as a YA writer, so I would expect more of her than what came through in this movie. I found it contrived and cliched, as well as inaccurate. The Jewish funeral at the beginning, for the protagonist's father, was ridiculously inaccurate. Kaddish is recited at the graveside, not Shema. The Native American ritual was likewise built on stereotype and very little knowledge of authentic tradition. &#34;Wolf,&#34; whom &#34;Tiger&#34; meets just too conveniently pops up at very contrived moments, and his father being in the hospital is just too precious and absurd. The characters are one-dimensional and cardboard. Even the small touches (a young girl climbs up a mountain in New Mexico and doesn't rip her jeans or get her hands dirty?), are poorly done.<br /><br />I can see where the end has healing and moving qualities. Perhaps my standards are a little high, as I am an adult and the movie was meant for teenagers or &#34;tween&#34;-agers. But any age group deserves the respect of accuracy when depicting religious traditions and rituals, and some complexity in the characters.",1,False

"This is a fun, very humorous, love story that was overlooked by the critics.  Set mainly within Provence, France at a beautiful chateau with scenes from London, Russell Crowe does a great job as an actor.  He is a funny, outrageous, smart, egocentric romantic who finds himself at a crossroad between his business life in London and a laid back style in Provence.  He is supported by Albert Finney, Marion Cotillard, Archie Punjabi, and Didier Bourdon, all of whom do a wonderful job.  The story swaps between the past and the present, giving impetus as to why two people who forgot they met as children, grow up in different cultures, and fall in love.

My next best/favorite movies are a toss up between the original Star Wars trilogy, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Harry Potter series. All frivolous compared to this movie. This one shows what CAN be done with a master film maker at the helm.<br /><br />It is not a movie you will want to watch repeatedly or often. About every ten to fifteenth years might be right. I've seen it twice, once when it first came out, in the theater, and later on DVD. And that is enough for me. It is a &#34;heavy hit,&#34; but a movie everyone should see at least once.",5,True

I liked this movie.  It is based on a true story from the mid 1750's in Pennsylvania.  The movie did not have a wide theatrical release so I did not expect a lot from the production.  The acting and production quality was much better than I expected for an independent release without a sizeable budget.

"Although, I've never read the original books by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  I suspect that this is a modernized version.  In this movie, which takes place in modern times.  The Greystokes own a large corporation that specializes in energy production. Mother & Father Greystoke are in Africa with their son trying to find an, as of yet, untapped source of energy.  Their helicopter crashes into the side of a remote ravine.  The only survivor is Tarzan who is found and cared for by a gorilla.  Time passes and Tarzan eventually becomes the ruler of the gorillas.  Greystoke Industries continues to search for the energy source and comes back into contact with Tarzan.<br /><br />I don't think the movie is bad.  The animation is ok.  The plot is fairly straight forward.  The problem is the Disney version of Tarzan is so good and entrenched in my memory that this one just can't compare on any level.

if anyone finds this an &#34;uplifting film&#34; I think its time to ring the Suicide Hotline !!! This was a combination of Ole Yella meets Betty Ford !  This is one more attempt from Hollywood to make us think that odd balls of society are the ruling factor.  A woman who has been widowed and retired for 20 years and drinks her lunch- decides to start smoking pot out of boredom and hasn't been out at night in 2 decades  is not something we need to aspire to !!!! Its a sad case of one wasting a life and not something that deserves a movie.  As far as the Director of this depression feast - are they truly getting that lazy that they no longer attempt a sound track or any form of background setting and the dinner scene was almost laughable !! ?? This is so dull and quite it is like watch a bad reality show ........ so the message is .....once your husband dies you hunker in the house with a case a wine?? NICE MESSAGE !  I would call this a case of &#34; A Conscious Uncoupling Of Talent&#34; !!!!,1,True
"For the first time in my 69 years, I'm reading &#34;Last of the Mohicans.&#34; Remembering there was a film, we decided to watch it, so as to have a visual while reading.<br />The photography is great. The casting and acting were great. But, I was particularly struck by the dissimilarities between the book and the film. Here is what they have in common:<br />Hawkeye and his two confederates; the Colonel and his daughters; the major, and the antagonist, Magua, were in both.<br />The plot of the movie was somewhat similar to that of the book, but enough different as to create wonder if they were intended to represent the same work. The beginning, middle and end of the movie were all different from the book.<br />Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but J. F. Cooper would not recognize it as his.",3,True

There's no human element to his character so you wonder how he has friends or love interests or anything.  He's trying so hard to seem like a tough guy, but he comes off as mild-to moderately autistic, not sociopathic.  Gosling goes for TOO mysterious to the point that it doesn't even make sense. And the director made this movie TOO stylized.  I don't buy this movie's stylized pop violence thing that it's trying to do.  Leave that stuff to Quentin Tarantino.  Trying way too hard.  Real bad movie.",1,False

"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers.

They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.

"Well made, well acted, well paced film about two estranged brothers, once a highly competitive doubles team, who reconcile with difficulty after years of separation in order to pursue success in the US Open. Jimmy Sisto, who developed the screenplay, is the older, more passionate (and disreputable) &#34;Alpha&#34; brother - David Walton his tightly wrapped sibling, a substitute teacher with a student minion, Joshua Rush. Initially nursing old grudges, they fight their way through qualifying tournaments (and a brief scuffle) as their relationship evolves from thinly veiled hostility to fraternal affection. The humor is mostly subtle, although Sisco laces his character's lines with plenty of F bombs. Amy Smart and J.K. Simmons are major supporting characters, but off court interaction between them and the two brothers is slow paced when contrasted with the realistic looking on-court action scenes.  A serious tennis fan or player (which I am not) would probably enjoy it much more than I did.",3,True

When I see movies like this, I often wonder about the people who do the editing - are they too involved in the movie to see that it makes no sense after they get through with it? I was 45 minutes into it before I understood what was going on - I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but the people I watched it with were just as clueless as I was.",1,False

Granted, the subject matter may bring questions to people's minds, as it is about three drag queens crossing the United States. It is given a PG-13 rating for that reason; however, it does take stereotypes of various types of people and turns them their ear. For that, I am grateful.",4,True

This is a story that needs telling, unfortunately this movie doesn't do it very well.<br /><br />The acting is mediocre at best and that may be doe to a poorly written story or just bad production.

"This could have been a great movie. It has a top notch A list cast, good director, but the way it was written was very poor.  I am not sure what was worse, the way it was written, or how it was put together post production.  Most good stories have 3 acts, beginning, middle, and end. This had one long beginning that crashed into and ending in the last 15 min.  Character setup dragged for the entire movie. You could not tell if it was a homicide at time, a drama, or romantic flick. Any conflict in the movie was muted, and it just dragged on.

She doesn't fit the rest of the cast and has been the center of the frustration this third season has brought.<br />The story line has dwindled as well but that's overlooked by the under-climactic scenes. I mean we've been waiting to see that baby born for what seems like forever now and episode 10 just put out the dwindling fire.

And the whole &#34;is he kinship, is he not&#34; is such a sad excuse for some added drama. Newsflash... They're under a freaking DOME! Tell the writers to get with it already.

"Pretty much every one of the cast members is painful to watch this season, but for different reasons: Shannon, because her marriage is disintegrating and she's in complete denial; Meghan because she's not the sharpest tool in the shed, and her awkward pauses during conversations where she's desperately searching for a word are distracting; Heather because her new house is obnoxious, Tamra because she's still on the show.. it's clear she's even getting on her husband's last  nerve, and they've only been married 2 years. I would have never thought that Vicky would be the most watchable or sane person on here, but it's been 10 seasons so I guess it was her turn. Probably not the best choice to film the actual moment she learned of her mother's death though.<br /><br />It might be time for the OC to go back behind the gates.

"This is really a poor movie all the way around. The storyline and script seemed like it was written by a grade schooler. The synopsis states '....accidentally prints out a DNA code that in the wrong hands can end the human race'. Nowhere is this stated in the movie, never mind expanded upon, you really don't know why the 'bad guys' are even after it. Bad script, bad acting, circumstances and events that just aren't believable - an example: 'hero' is driving to save daughter, stops for gas, gas station attendant - an old fat guy recognizes the hero on TV as being wanted by the police, hero goes to get in his car and leave - but the attendant has the keys and sticks tongue out at the hero. Instead of grabbing the keys, clocking the attendant, and ripping out the phone, this guy takes off running toward a destination we are led to believe is still miles away - while the gas station attendant calmly calls the police. This scene is actually worse when you watch it. Don't be drawn into the 'X-File' like cover art, that really is where any similarity ends. The 'Riff Trax' / MST3K crew could have a field day with this one.....",1,True
"The lead character, Sydney, is an alcoholic, chain smoking, carousing priest who partners with a an alcoholic, chain smoking detective to solve crimes. Social themes are presented anachronistically in the 1950's setting, with the tolerance that is expected in 2015. The two voices of propriety are an overly stern house keeper and a mousy curate with no confidence.<br />It's unfortunate that a potentially good show is ruined by depressing themes.

After giving the movie ~25 minutes' chance, we unanimously decided to turn it off. Perhaps we'll try again in a few years, but even for adults this was hard to watch!...<br /><br />We love the beautiful Astoria, OR. Hated the movie.",1,False

"The basic message of this movie is focusing on satisfying your spiritual needs will make you happier than focusing on satisfying your material needs. This not really a groundbreaking idea, but the movie did make me stop and think about my priorities. Ultimately though the movie offered little beyond that, as their examples of happy people were a woman in Denmark who moved into a commune, a man who gave up his life to take care of the terminally ill in Kolkata, India, and an excruciatingly long sequence of elderly women in Okinawa, Japan who were happy because they met each other regularly, lived off the land, and took care of each other's grandchildren. Obviously nobody is going to be in these extreme situations, I wish the movie had focused more on how average people had improved their happiness. The other message was that surrounding yourself with family constantly would improve your happiness, but I can't stand most of my family members, so what do you do then? Movie had a lot promise, but ultimately delivered an overly simplistic message. Needed more depth, and more realistic examples of how people could improve.",3,False
"This was a movie that I thought looked interesting when I saw previews of it when it came out in theatres.  It ended up being added to the list of interesting looking movies I never got around to seeing.  Big mistake.  Ex Machina turned out to be one of the best movies I have seen all year.  The premise is fascinating yet simple - An employee of a large computer company wins a week long stay at the companies founders retreat.  The company founder is a legendary genius who has dropped off the grid to work on some secret project.  The project turns out to be artificial intelligence.  His creation is the lovely looking machine like creation seen in the advertisements, so I'm not giving anything away.  The premise then is turned on it's ear as we are taken into the relationships which are formed between the creator, the employee, and the creation.  It is a testament to the acting and filmmaking that your beliefs and alliances get all tangled up and twisted.  Some people may be put off by a concern the movie will be too technical or highbrow.  While it does have its moments, there was never a point where it went too far and lost the viewer.  It is not at all like &#34;2001 A Space Odyssey&#34;.  That movie has always been a divisive wrestling match between people.  This movie instead manages to be thoughtful and thought provoking without going over the top.  The ending comes with a surprise twist, and it is perfect.  It is not at all contrived to make things fit into a neat little box.  The cinematography is wonderful - claustrophobic, foreboding, yet beautiful.  The juxtaposition between nature and technology are all around, and it all adds to the mood of the film.  Extremely well done and inspired.  Although it probably will be forgotten around Oscar time, the set design is fantastic.  There is swearing, drinking, and nudity, none of which is gratuitous.  Highly recommended.",5,False

"SPOILER (this is the opening scene):<br /><br />The camera pans up and across the crest of a small rise.  The smoking and burning silhouettes of tanks cover a debris-ridden battlefield, including a couple of Panther tanks.  A Sherman tank sits amongst the wreckage.  All is quiet.  Into this scene rides some German (officer?) on a white horse leisurely clip clopping along.  &#34;Do-dee-do-dee-do, just out for a morning ride.  Good thing we must have cleared this battlefield and pushed the Americans way back so I can just plod along here with no real purpose or concern.  Nothing to worry about here.&#34;  &#34;Iii-eeeee!!!!&#34;  From out of the shadows of the top of the Sherman, a wild man vaults onto the horseman, propels them both to the ground, and then stabs the horseman deep into the eye as the camera goes in for a closeup.  After pulling his knife out, we see the ambusher is none other than Brad Pitt.  He mumbles some stuff, pats the horse on the head and then hops back on the Sherman and climbs in.  We quickly discern his tank was disabled in the battle and the crew is hiding inside trying to get it fixed.  Good thing Brad took care of the only person on either side curious about how the battle came out or these guys might be in a world of trouble.<br /><br />A few war crimes presented as standard operating procedure, some more odd events, and multiple f-bombs later, we get to an improbable battle at the end and we're done - bringing it all artistically together by showing a white horse again.",1,True

"Kudos to the writer of an engaging and well-crafted story of self-sacrifical love, bitterness, and forgiveness. Now, if the acting could be as good as the script. Some wonderful moments were lost by the wooden performance of Redford (he was out of he element in a dramatic role) and the lightweight Jennifer Lopez. Morgan Freeman was, well, Morgan Freeman and his performance in a role that seemed written for his large cinematic persona was predictable. But the weight he brings to any role made the others pale by comparison. Decca Gardner (as Griff) has better days ahead as she grows into her acting ability.<br /><br />Josh Lucas did as much as he could with a limited character of Sherif Curtis, and Damian Lewis as the abusive boyfriend was appropriately malevolent and not too over the top, which is easy to do in that role. Carmen Manheim was, again, over her head in an otherwise fairly simply role.<br /><br />I haven't read the book but the screenplay teased out the storyline in a way that kept me interested (despite the acting) and surprised at points. There were a few forced story threads (making a to-do out of forgiving the bear that mauled and crippled you)...but don't know if it was better told in the book than the movie.<br /><br />In all, I wouldn't watch it again but there was enough to enjoy in the first viewing.",3,True

"Song of the Sea is an absolutely gorgeous animated film that is equally enchanting, adorable, and heartbreaking.<br /><br />I remember when Big Hero 6 won the 2015 Oscar for Best Animated Film, and I remember there was an overwhelming gnashing of teeth from people who were all, &#34;What even? It wasn't that good!&#34; and I, not having seen Song of the Sea (or Boxtrolls, or Kaguya), was thinking that they were a bunch of sore losers and that Big Hero 6, even with its flaws, was a great movie with fun characters, quick plot, and good lessons, and deserved the win.<br /><br />After I watched Song of the Sea, I found myself in the camp of teeth gnashers. It's not that Big Hero 6 isn't a good movie, Song of the Sea is simply a BETTER one.<br /><br />The same storybook style that was so intriguing in the Secret of the Kells has evolved into something transcendent in Song of the Sea. The characters are very relatable even if you are not familiar with the Irish backdrop and the inheritance of Irish folklore that runs through this film's veins (heaven knows I was a bit lost with all that talk of Tir Na Nog and giants and fairies). The main character is a little boy who loses his mother on the night his sister is born. The loss breaks his father and induces the paternal grandmother to try and get the kids to stay with her, in the city, instead of on their little lighthouse island. We see how much the little boy resents his sister, and though it's clear that it's unjustified--she's a sweet, curious, and quiet little girl--we still can't help but sympathize with him a bit. This starting point makes his subsequent physical journey as he tries to get back to his lighthouse home from his grandma's house in the city, and the emotional growth as he finally confronts the wounds in his heart and tries to find closure to a tragedy, all the more substantial. You see real character development, and it happens in such a natural, organic way (even with all the fairies and owls about).<br/><br />Put it this way--the movie's ending is heartbreaking, whether you read too deeply into the symbolism of it or not. But it's also strangely uplifting, as though the whole movie is meant to be heartbreaking, until the very end, when sadness becomes acceptance, and acceptance into joy at a new day.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film to both children and adults. I'm not sure who would cry more: mom and dad, or the kids. My husband and I blubbered quite a bit at some points, but it was cathartic in its own way, so I'll consider it a bonus. I fully intend to add this movie to my hardcopy collection; it really is that good. Better than an inflatable robot hero.",5,True

"The total budget is unknown to me, but 1,527 backers pledged $94,294 on Kickstarter towards the production of Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (MQH). Even if the total cost ended up as high as $3M, that's still a paltry sum for a movie that requires shoots in semi-remote locations, special effects in numerous scenes, and the creation of specialized sets, props, and costumes. The 1st Hobbit flick (2012) had an estimated budget of $180M, which is maybe 60-150x the price tag of MQH. Was the 1st Hobbit flick 100x better than MQH? Not by a longshot.

"FINAL DESTINATION is a color movie taking place in the present era.  The plot concerns a group of high school students taking an overseas field trip to France.  The high school students are accompanied by two adult teachers.  During the first half hour, the students gather in an airplane terminal and board the plane.  Then, one of the students takes a nap and has a dream where a latch handle falls of from the flip-down table at his seat, where the plane then starts shaking, where oxygen masks all are released into the passenger compartment, where a fire starts inside the cabin, where a chunk of the wall blows out and a passenger is sucked out of her seat into the atmosphere, and where the plane crashes.  Then, the student wakes up from his awful dream, and tugs on the latch handle, and it falls off just like in his dream.  Then, the student realizes that this is a harbinger of the airplane crash.  At this point, the plane has not yet taken off.  The student (Devon Sawa) raises and alarm and rushes out of the airplane, and a handful of the other students join him and leave the airplane.  The group of students watch the airplane take off from the runway, and they are shocked when they see the airplane blow up in mid-air.  The remaining hour of the movie concerns the notion that the fate of each of the surviving students is somehow predetermined, and that each of the surviving students will soon die.  Two agents from the FBI spend this remaining  hour tailing the student.  The actors playing the FBI agents are very good, and this aspect of the plot adds a further dimension of suspense to the plot.<br /><br />Much of the movie concerns the role of fate in killing off the surviving students and the surviving teacher.  Because of the somewhat repetitive aspects of this portion of the plot, it might be reasonable to characterize FINAL DESTINATION as a &#34;B movie.&#34;  But it is a good movie, and it provides food for thought regarding the concept of pre-destination.  Theending of this movie is not really a distinct one.  The plot just sort of withers away suddenly.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS.  The special effects are excellent.  The tilting and shaking of the airplane, as depicted in the student's dream, is excellent.  The fire and explosion where a chunk of the wall is blown out, is very realistic looking.  After the airplane sequence, much of the rest of the movie shows electric sparks, tumbling kitchen knives the plunge into a schoolteacher's chest, and fires caused by spilled alcoholic beverages.  These are all realistic.<br /><br />TWENTY TWO.  The closest story that I know to FINAL DESTINATION is a Twilight Zone episode called, Twenty Two.  Twenty Two stars Barbara Nichols, who is a nightclub dancer experiencing mental exhaustion.  She is in a hospital receiving care for her exhaustion, when one of the hospital employees (Arlene Martel) who works in the hospital's morgue says to Barbara Nichols, &#34;Room for one more, honey.&#34;  Arlene Martel (who is more like a spirit than a real person) also provides a warning to Barbara Nichols, right before boarding an airplane.  Barbara Nichols decides to return to the terminal, and from the terminal she sees the airplane blowing up.  Hence, in my opinion, watching Twenty Two will enhance your enjoyment and appreciation of FINAL DESTINATION.  Another Twilight Zone episode should also be mentioned.  This is PRIVATE CHANNEL from the color Twilight Zone episodes, from 1986-1987.  PRIVATE CHANNEL is just as excellent as TWENTY TWO, but since it is of more recent cinematographic vintage, it is the case the the acting in PRIVATE CHANNEL has much more pizzazz.  Scott Coffey plays the starring role, as man about 18 to 22 years old, who acquires a premonition that his airplane will crash.  Scott Coffey ends up saving all the passengers of a jet plane (including himself) from a bomb.  To repeat, both of these Twilight Zone episodes have a plot similar to that in FINAL DESTINATION, and will likely enhance your enjoyment of FINAL DESTINATION.",4,True

"Season 1 was great, season 2 was ok, but at this point I am only sticking around to find out the meaning of the dome itself. What attracted me to this show was the breakdown and rebuilding of a society during a disaster, and the possible supernatural tie-in. Season 2, I forgave, because most sophomore seasons are exposition-laden, wobbly and never really as good as the first. Season 3... Well, this season was very painful to watch. The dialogue was predictable and uninspired (Dean Norris, you have been robbed!), and the plot is super messy. It's as if the point of this season was to render all of season 2 moot, by essentially getting rid of characters and story lines that were prominent in it (what was the point of the Melanie character at all? Or Junior's Mom and that damn red door?) and using a warped-time line to force the plot into some other crazy direction.<br /><br />It seems the &#34;in thing&#34; to kill off main characters in shows these days, which is something I applaud: in my belief, the story should come first, not the actors' contracts or network's pocketbooks. But there are 3 deaths in the first two episodes that just didn't even need to happen. The story didn't move forward, or anywhere, because of those deaths. And, as a woman, I am against woman-shaming, but Marg Helgnberger's lips need some serious fixing. That's all I can think about in her scenes, and she has so very many scenes! SPOILER ALERT: I am only sticking around because I heard the dome comes down this season. With one episode left, it better!  I don't think I'll be back to watch this next year. Stephen King, you've disappointed me here, but I will buy the book. It has to be a million times better than the show!<br /><br />9/8/15 Update: yay!

"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers.

They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.

Had the movie been simply about an invention gone awry then it would have been ok.",1,False
"This is a well researched and informative documentary, and worth watching just for the interviews with Georgia O'Keefe. How they got her to agree to be interviewed, I don't know, but it says something about the producers that they were able to accomplish this.<br /><br />We've all seen Mr. Strand's photos, so I think the whole point in watching a movie about him is to learn more about him and his life.<br />I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought the (quite brief, actually) segment about his career in film making was slow, as my impression was quite the opposite, and since this is a documentary film and Mr. Strand spent many years as a movie cameraman it's completely logical that this would also be a part of the film, not just his still photography. I thought this segment was very interesting, especially to see his film making style, which reminded me of Sergei Eisenstein's, and which we probably won't see anywhere else, and to learn that he was taking on very serious subjects such as racial intolerance, the KKK, and McCarthyism. Also that his decision to move to Europe was largely because of these issues.<br /><br />Seeing Mr. Strand wielding his monstrously huge Graflex SLR (5x7?) was also a highlight.<br /><br />The musical soundtrack was nothing special, kind of typical of a low budget documentary, but I wasn't watching the movie to listen to the music. The &#34;Ken Burns&#34; style of showing the photos was the weakest and most distracting part of the film for me. I felt that the film makers should have displayed the photos in full view first, and then panned around if they felt the need to push that button on iMovie. If the rest of the film had not been so informative I would have knocked a star off for this, but there was so much else about it that was really good that I kept it at five.<br /><br />I was not surprised at the end to learn from the credits that this film was funded by the Canadian National Film Board. I have watched numerous documentaries funded by this agency, and they have all been of high quality. One can also go to their website and watch a lot of movies for free. Most of them were made by the CBC.",5,True

I was hoping for a more global view of the initial spread of the virus, but instead I am stuck following a dysfunctional family and an addict - both of which are totally stupid.

Living in Oklahoma, I wanted so much to learn more about this pivotal time in our history.

I had never heard most of the facts regarding how this disaster was man-made or what brought &#34;no man's land&#34; to that point. I really appreciate that this video gives first-hand accounts, focusing on real families and individuals and how they were personally affected by all that occurred. It gives a realistic, yet personal view of history while giving me the opportunity to truly consider what it must have been to live through something so devastating. Truly powerful. My one complaint is simply the length - but that &#34;complaint&#34; is meager, as it does not drag or seem needlessley lengthy.

"Joe Swanberg is changing the face of American independent cinema. In a matter of ten years, he’s managed to direct eighteen feature films (including his latest “Digging For Fire”). Most of these have been made completely outside of the studio-system, being financed through credit cards and actors donating their time. They’re purely improvisational, with Swanberg’s only tool being an outline that he’s authored. The actors, in turn, must completely inhabit their characters to the point of knowing what they might say or even do. “Digging For Fire”, which is undoubtedly his most star-studded film to date, takes this to a whole new level. Veterans such as Sam Elliott and Judith Light are sharing the screen with younger actors like Jake Johnson and Rosemarie DeWitt.<br /><br />The latter couple playing a husband and wife who, after finding a rusted gun and apparent human bone in the backyard of a house they’re staying in, are lead on separate adventures over the course of one weekend. The husband - obviously more curious about what else he might find - invites a group of his long-time friends to drink a few beers and dig up the truth. Meanwhile, his wife takes their son to visit her parents and get away from some of the marital stresses she’s facing.<br /><br />It’s this wonderfully odd comedy/mystery that’s entirely propelled by the connection between the actors and the director. There’s an evident trust between the two, and the movie is infinitely better for that. Not to mention the fact that it’s just a lot of fun to watch. The varied cast works together beautifully (some of the others include Orlando Bloom, Anna Kendrick, and Sam Rockwell) and the story unfolds in a charming and clever fashion. Definitely give Swanberg’s latest film a look. He has a long and storied career ahead of him.",5,True
"I really enjoyed this movie.  There is a good, solid Christian message in there-even though my 34-year marriage is great, this movie made me pause and think about it, and how I could make it even better.  There were some intense, nail-biting action scenes which made the movie even more enjoyable.  On top of all that, it has Kirk Cameron in it-I just love him and think he is a terrific actor.  It really impresses me that he sticks to his faith and stars in Christian movies instead of going the Hollywood route and taking anything he can for exposure to the public.  If you are addicted to the Hollywood blockbusters with outlandish plots, you may not enjoy this.  But if you are looking for a solid, faith-based, down-to-earth movie, please watch this-I highly recommend it!!",5,True

"Great movies were made during the time of this production—without gratuitous sex (or its overtures) and without undue violence. Bogart and Tierney were superb in their roles, and quite touching. I was sad to learn that it was during this production that Miss Tierney (how wonderfully beautiful she was) —it was during this time that she began manifesting deep depression which plagued her most of her life. I thought, how utterly sad; but how wonderful (as I read) that Mr. Bogart was such an understanding and benevolent gentleman, who, when needed, often fed Miss Tierney her lines, as she had great difficulty in some scenes. The acting was somewhat understated, which, to me, made the roles all the more to be cherished an lauded in this day of violence, untoward behavior, and everything seemingly disturbed and evil.. I will watch this movie again, and that is how I know that I appreciate a film. Look at the beautiful Tierney and . . . well, I don't know what else to say, except just to see her made the film worthwhile for me.

"A year and a half ago I left an abusive marriage with the help of a local women's shelter, so I could not watch much of this movie because my experiences were just too recent. I will watch more of it at a later time, when I feel I can handle the emotions. The only thing I would say is that abuse is not always this visible in public. Only in a place where social conventions uphold this type of treatment does it seem like a man would be able to demonstrate his abuse in public (though as one reviewer noted, some do not approve of his behavior). Where conventions have changed, abuse goes on in secret. My heart goes out to Ninah, and to every woman her character represents. It seems like a well made film. I hope other viewers will pardon my writing a review after having only watched a short amount.",5,True

"Yeah, it's one of the movies from the 80's that was cheesy even when it was made, but I love Penelope in the movie.  She's upbeat and interesting the whole of the movie as a protagonist.  Tim Daly is great,and it wouldn't be the same movie without him, but it's between Penelope and Louis Jourdan, the antagonist, for the movie's character.  Most movies are made, for me, within the first few seconds with this movie it's when Penelope goes to Scotland, this is where the upbeat character of the movie is cemented.<br /><br />The plot line is thin, although not implausible; it's the scenery and upbeat story line, with little funny one offs strewn throughout the movie, that makes the movie fun to watch.  This to me is another, 'Better Off Dead' or 'Grosse Point Blank'",5,True

The depiction of life for average people in London during that period, the unbelievable pain and suffering caused by infectious illnesses and trauma, and the level of compassion (and angst) portrayed by the nurses and doctors left an indelible impression.  Several scenes of surgery were quite graphic, which could make some people very squeamish, but they added to the power of the program.",5,True

It won't win any awards, but I got exactly what I hoped for - A fun unique horror experience to enjoy with some friends.",4,False

Larry David is a genius and in some ways this show is even funnier than Seinfeld (and I loved Seinfeld). This is the most unusual and strange idea for a series:  a kind of pseudo reality show about his own life: how a very wealthy writer who could disappear to a Caribbean island forever if he wanted instead leads a somewhat normal celebrity life in Los Angeles. He can't seem to keep his foot out of his mouth for five seconds and all of his good intentions seem bent on destroying every relationship he's ever had (or ever will have). Very funny. My kind of show.,5,True
Too many subliminal Satanic messages for this to get a good rating. The story line is your typical &#34;why-time-travel-is-a-terrible-idea&#34; story with a British type-cast. It's like what would happen if Back to the Future had a baby with The Antiques Road Show.,1,False

"If you like Christopher Guest's improv-style movies (This Is Spinal Tap, Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, etc.), BBC television, and aren't too squeamish when it comes to R-rated content (really bad language, implied sex, and...I seem to recall there was some nudity, although only one scene), you're probably going to LOVE Family Tree. The characters are hilarious, and strangely Guest managed to include many of his favorite actors, including Michael McKean, Fred Willard, and, of course, Christopher Guest himself.<br /><br />Chris O'Dowd (from The IT Crowd) plays an Irishman from an English family who starts searching for his family roots after his late aunt leaves him a box of junk that turns out to be full of clues about his family's history. Eventually his quest leads him to California where he discovers a bunch of distant and strange relatives. The series ends unexpectedly with the main character torn between returning home and staying in California. It definitely feels like this show was meant to get a second season, but alas that didn't happen.<br /><br />One thing I love about the series is that the female characters are often funnier than the men. The main character's sister is deeply attached to a monkey puppet with a filthy mouth, and the main character's stepmother... let me just say there's a scene involving her where she isn't seen and you can't even hear her, but she made me laugh so long and hard.<br /><br />The whole thing is shot faux documentary style, which shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Christopher Guest's work. In many ways, it reminds me of the original UK version of The Office, but without a drop of meanness. Chris O'Dowd's character has an open heart, and he's more than willing to embrace anything and everything he discovers about his family, no matter how insane it may be.<br /><br />I loved this show. The only problem I had with it (except for one unnecessary R-rated scene) is that it ended way too soon. It would be great if someone picked it up for a second season. Amazon, are you listening?eat if someone picked it up for a second season. Amazon, are you listening?",5,True

The acting is decent, and though its rather predictable (what movie isn't, really?), its good to see a horror movie that relies on context and environment cues to give the audience the creeps, rather than slash and gore cheap thrills.

"Classic movie, great cast which took me back many, many years.  From an era where most movie plots involved the glamour of the big city, this story was realistically based in a small town in the UP, and the movie sets were appropriate.  FYI, the movie is based on a book authored by Robert Travers, a judge better known for his writings about fly fishing.  Hence, the Stewart character's obsession with fishing.<br /><br />Loved seeing Jimmy Steward, Lee Remick, George C. Scott, and Eve Arden in action again.",4,False
"You know, I actually enjoy many cheesy sci-fi and disaster B movies. Some of them are unintentionally funny and this one was downright hilarious only because it was SOOO bad that we spent the whole time mimicking the characters who ALL seemed to be heavily medicated or at least had IQs below 50. But curiously, there were several scenes and characters that had NO relevance to the story, other scenes that only served to illustrate some cliche profiling sterotypes, and gratuitous flashes of female body parts (the Sharon Stone effect) which were apparently only due to unfortunate camera angles. As for special effects or CGI content ...it was probably the worst I have ever seen. The tsunami was seemingly a Magic Tsunami that didn't actually destroy anything. Instead things just faded and disappeared while the unmoving wave hovered in the background spitting out what looked like puffs of dust. A second grader's cardboard shoebox diorama would have worked better. If I were rating this on the amount of thigh-slapping guffaw laughter it generated, then it would be five stars. But since money would have to be spent to see it, something I would like to get back along with that hour and a half of my life, then I have to go with a one star rating only because I cannot choose negative numbers of stars.",1,True

"Being able to review movies without knowing what you're talking about is just dumb. While trying to tell people what to like and what not to like is idiotic.<br /><br />You have to have a certain taste to appreciate any movie. You wont like it if it isn't your taste. Thats what trailers are for. You shouldn't have watched this film if the trailer didn't appeal to you.<br /><br />To the 1 star reviews.<br /><br />How dare you come here and tell people whats good and what isn't.<br /><br />Thats like telling people what genre music they should listen to.<br /><br />This isn't an appliance review where if it works it gets 4- 5 stars and if it doesn't it should get 1-2.<br /><br />This is an Action movie. Not a drama. Meaning there doesn't have to be an in depth story. Its also the first movie in a modern day trilogy and its not a mad max reboot. Its a continuation.

"First, I have always been a big U.N.C.L.E. fan all my life from the very first episode which was aired on September 21, 1964.  I was only 9 years old at the time but &#34;the man from U.N.C.L.E&#34; left a lifelong impression on me.  It's one of the driving reasons I went into Law Enforcement.  I collected anything and everything that was U.N.C.L.E related and still have that collection today!<br /><br />So, with all this in mind, here is my take on the movie: If one is expecting to see the show with hopes of re-experiencing our two favorite agents entering the secret entrance to the New York HQ via Del Floria's Tailor Shop you are going to be disappointed!  Because this is NOT the premise of the movie.<br /><br />However, for all the fans that can get into the idea of seeing a prequel on how, Illya Kuryakin, Napoleon Solo and Alexander Waverly first meet (and getting to know a lot more about all their backgrounds); then you are in for a treat!  The movie does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of life in the early 1960’s and set stage for a great spy thriller of two agents (one CIA and the other KGB) being forced to work together to prevent an international criminal organization from using a Nuclear bomb to instigate a world crisis. While THURSH is never mentioned by name; we all know who is behind this!<br /><br />The movie is fast paced, full of car chases, plot twists, intrigue, plot twists and even double twists to keep the most avid spy and mystery lover guessing all the way through the end of movie!  You can take nothing for granted and many things and people are not what they seem!  For hardcore U.N.C.L.E. fans your will get to see our beloved “U.N.C.L.E Carbine Special” faithfully reproduced make an appearance in several of the big battle scenes near the end of the movie!<br /><br />Bottom line this is a classic spy/action thriller!  With lots of classic U.N.C.L.E humor thrown in to break the mood when thing get a little too intense!  No spoilers here so you will have to see the nail biting end for yourselves; but it is worth the manicure to get there!!",5,True

"The perfectly perfect Kate Winslet portrays a widow who must make her living in a metier most often practiced by men, that of landscape design.<br />So naturally, and with little struggle, she's commissioned to add a garden to the palace at Versailles. The plot of this film may be a little thin and probably historians are tearing out their hair over the lack of historical accuracy but, nevertheless, A Little Chaos has great charm and is beautifully filmed. The star performances are evenly low key and several familiar faces seem to have fun in their supporting roles. Alan Rickman, who also directs, may be the calmest Louis XIV ever seen on screen. There ought to be more overt passion, but alas. In any case, I'd recommend A Little Chaos to all. Four stars, for sure, and five stars for the whole look of it, costumes, sets, cinematography.",4,True

This started out being hard to figure out as to whether it was really going to be a show that valued integrity and truth, and actually the first couple of episodes we were still believers.  Seeing unannounced Jane Fonda quietly take the scene made us suspicious.  And then before long the bs got deeper and deeper and we quit about a quarter of the way through episode 4 of season 1.  If you drink the koolaid of the cult then this is for you.  It puts a spin on the spin to make it seem like the lies are true.

I highly recommend this stylistically well made movie because it is just so amazing when I see the horse jumping around the field and bring hopes to the people in the Great War.<br />The background of the movie happened during the World War I. The horse, named Joey, did not give up on his life during the Great War. Joey brought hopes to the devastated soldiers on both Allies and Germans. During World War I, millions of people died because the war was fought in a different way, as known as trench war. Generals make soldiers dig trenches to make defiance and it makes the offence become very hard, and even more, the troops are already using machine guns from the beginning of the war and millions of people will die under the machine guns. When Joey ran in to the field, there are wires and bodies everywhere. Suddenly, Joey was trapped in the wires and both Germans and British soldiers can’t believe what they are seeing – a living animal at the middle of the war zone. The appeared of Joey makes both German and British send a soldiers to help rescue him and that makes troops on both sides disengage for a while. After Joey was rescued, he was send back to the doctor for surgery and at the same place is where he met his original owner, Albert. After the war, Joey and Albert went back to home together and the movie end with a happy ending.<br />After watching the whole movie, I can feel the powerful vitality spreading from Joey, miracles happened on this creature. He makes me believe that I shouldn’t give up on anything. Really, everyone should go watch this movie. It definitely worth it.",4,True

"Great if you like some diversions into good historical fiction. The effect is true to the essence of Marquis de Sade: his unstoppable compulsion and his affect on the social mores of those around him, in the culture at-large at the time, and to this day in the &#34;conflict&#34; between pure desire and &#34;proper&#34; behavior. The film is not pornographic, or pornographic for its own sake, using just enough to affirm the power of Sade's appeal and compulsion. Everything else aside, the gem of the film is the depiction of Sade's compulsive behavior: relentless, purposeful, never reflective, unstoppable under impossible circumstances. The film takes place in a mental hospital, where Sade has been confined by officialdom in the hope his volatile influence on French culture will be eliminated (and a progressive pastor/superintendent hopes he may be reformed). But he must write and publish his pornography. Sade will find a way despite every possible effort by the officials to remove any ability. Again and again, just when you think he can't possibly find a way, he does, an in ways that richly illustrate Sade's utter, devouring compulsion. The effect is powerful. For me, the lasting impression is the incredible power of the human spirit against all odds, up to and including destruction.",5,True

Some of the dialog between the mixed members of the Family of the Indian Father  and Black Female Mother were simply hilarious an well done.",4,True
"I watched the Jobs vs Gates episode and I don't know whether to watch the other ones, because there are some inaccuracy and misconception in the program.

Well, how can documentaries be &#34;inspired by History&#34;? It is very irresponsible.  The misconception is that one of the person giving the comment said that mainframe are these super computers operated by computer experts and Bill Gates know how to do it.  Well, actually, when in 1982, an Apple II can be already more complicated than the mainframes.  So knowing how to deal with the mainframe is not something &#34;genius&#34;.  The second inaccuracy is about Microsoft bundling Word and Excel with every copy of Windows.  As far as I know, that was not true.  You buy Windows, and all the time, you also have to buy Word, Excel, or Office separately.  The TV program said there was no choice for people to buy Windows without having Word or Excel -- that Word and Excel were already bundled and people have to get it together with Windows or a new PC.",3,False

"While  in agreement  this is not one of Cameron Crowe's strongest efforts, it is far from being a bad film.  I personally believe sometimes when an A-list talent like Mr. Crowe  comes out with a highly anticipated movie, that the bar  for the critics and the audience is already somewhat higher from the outset.  So, I believe the playing field is not quite level from the outset when reviewing the film compared with other films of the same ilk.<br /> So, what I believe is a film that is worthwhile and enjoyable has been simply knit picked to death, from what was considered questionable casting of the Emma stone character to the pace of the movie etc.  The bottom line is, this film was enjoyable, well acted and worthy of an audience.<br /> It is simply a fun, lighthearted  well directed romance film that will likely not disappoint 80% of the people that give it a shot.

"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967. They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's. Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",4,True

"EARLY PLOT SPOILER<br /><br />The best way to watch this film is cold, having read no reviews including this one. Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34; Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?",3,True

Our pediatrician is impressed so I'd definitely recommend sitting down with your kid(s) and watching the show and engaging with them.  I remember the shows from my childhood as well so it has a bit of nostalgia to it.  It does wear thin on adults (my wife and I included) but that's the price of having a child right?

From my own personal experience I tell you do it now. If you're alone, no friends, no family and no one who cares, specifically yourself. Deep inside of you there is a soul or call it heart, the terminology doesn't matter, but that part wants to live. Dig into that part, do whatever it takes to make people, strangers, those in the medical field or anyone notice you're hurt and broken and that you don't really care. If you keep trying to get someone to notice, a good someone. Someone who enjoys giving instead of taking will see you.

"Was an excellently produced film but liked the soundtrack in the first one better. The second in this series felt as if something more was left out, but will wait with baited breath for the final film, as I read the entire series in about two weeks & was mezmerized by each one! Perhaps I should have waited to see the films first, but the Divergent left me impatient for more, and Insurgent, while graphically brilliant, didn't do the same for me. The relationship between Tris and Four wasn't as powerful as it appeared in Divergent, or all 3 books, but it still had outstanding moments that gave its audience an urge to stand up & cheer out loud at the screen! (Sorry - no spoilers from me!)<br />The real test will be Allegient's release next year, and the way the writers/director portray its incredible ending to Veronica Roth's genius work! All in all, I still loved the movie (and Shailene Woodley doesn't disappoint either!) so would highly recommend watching it several times to catch all the subtle events going on in the film. Then get yourself to a bookstore and buy this gripping and easy-reading trilogy for an in depth explanation of SO much more that just had to be left on the cutting-room floors!

Her little brother seems to have gotten the least of it, but nope, he dies too.  While all this is going on she is having an out of body experiences and basically has to decide if she's going to go towards the light like her family.

"In a time where Vampires, werewolves, and even zombies are being put through the &#34;Twilight&#34; treatment, stripping them of all their terror and replacing it with lukewarm sex appeal, What We Do In The Shadows takes the desiccated husk of all these poor horror icons and injects them with some humorous new life. Instead of making the monsters terrifying or sexy to braindead underage girls, they give them a sense of humanity and a desire to simply live life like us normal, pre-dead average joes.<br /><br />With talents like Jemaine Clement of Flight of The Conchords in the lead roles, this film is filled with hilarious scenes of blood-sucking, shapeshifting, and in some cases monstrous vampires dealing the the troubles of modern day life. Ever wonder if vampires hate getting blood on the carpet during every meal? Well it's addressed here in hilarious fashion. How does someone who has recently been turned into a vampire essentially &#34;come out&#34; to his best friend while addressing the elephant in the room, that many of his new friends want to eat said best friend? You have the best friend introduce the new vampire friends to the wonders of modern technology! Ever wonder what happens when two vampires have an argument? They turn into bats and fight one another.<br /><br />Simply said, What We Do In The Shadows is a hilarious film brimming with tons of dark humor lightened by the fact that these creatures of the night just want to have a good time and get the rent paid on time.",4,True

"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967.  They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.  Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",4,True

I get that things are going to be out of order and combined.  Usually it's not a big deal.  In this movie, I just felt like they missed the mark.

"The trailer is misleading. It promises a traditional/simple romantic comedy. Instead this film tries to fit several genres and doesn't succeed in any of them due to the lack of character development and storyline.<br /><br />There were 4 different stories going on in the movie and none of them seemed plausible or interesting.<br /><br />1. Bradley Cooper returns to Hawiia to prove himself/succeed in business. (His reputation is good enough that he is on this job, and everyone trusts him to handle tricky issues at hand.But all the characters in the movie feel entitled to say what a jerk he is...Huh?)<br /><br />2. Hawiian people are mistreated by the government and conned by Cooper/Murray. (Yeah this storyline really never goes anywhere and seems more a political statement by the writer.)<br /><br />3. The romantic storyline between Stone and Cooper. She is obnoxious and Uncharming. (She is a female Sheldon Cooper.) He seems more interested in his Ex.<br /><br />4. McAdams and Cooper resolving the past and accepting the present. Both seem very happy in their present circumstances, so it made no sense why after 13 years they would meet up. (What drove these 2 characters to come together at that moment versus 13 years ago or 20 years from the present?)<br /><br />And after all the revelations to tie up all 4 plots, everyone is EXTREMELY RELAXED. I would have thought more yard decorations would be decapitated.",2,False

"This had its moments, but from the beginning I felt like I was watching these two doing their impressions of Kristen Wiig and Joaqu&iacute;n Phoenix, and doing it badly. I love Kristen Wiig and her choices of movies, and I really think that Joaqu&iacute;n Phoenix is a good actor, but I can't say the same about these two. Although, Adam Pally is better at it than Sarah Burns is in this, but I have to admit, I have not seen either of them in any other movie (that I am aware of) so I can't really say they are bad actors 100% of the time, only in this. I felt for both of these people they were portraying immediately, I actually cared for them, I had high hopes. About midway through, I stopped caring for her completely, mainly I guess (maybe) it could be that she may actually had been acting so well that her character made me dislike her, but, whatever, I don't think that the makers of this movie wanted that to happen. (The script itself is probably at fault here , so that also means all of those in charge were at fault) In any movie you need to care about the characters, if you go too far and those in charge make you actually stop caring, you are going to be on a very slippery slope, and these slid all of the way down the hill as far as I was concerned. Yes, I do know that Sarah's character was supposed to be this way, but too much is just too much. The character, &#34;Beth&#34; would've been a better choice for Sarah's part, I feel, I liked her more, and she had some acting skills and her and Adam had good chemistry together.<br />The premise for this movie was good enough, I liked the idea, and had it been handled by writers and directors, plus, the actors, just a little better, I would be writing a different review. (I am not a very good reviewer, I only do this if I am 'trying to' help someone either see a good movie, or, stay away from one that may be considered a bad one)<br />Also really, I am not a prude at all, but this had quite a bit of raunchy humor in it that was unnecessary, there is no need to say all of the stuff they said, especially that many times, and I promise, I say those words myself, but for me, in a romantic comedy they should not be raunchy. (That's just how I feel, I am old-fashioned that way) To me, a successful romantic comedy is one like, Sleepless in Seattle, (I know, I know) they did it right, so well in fact, they had immediate copycat movies by others that followed their lead, even the same directors and producers tried to keep that formula going with, You Got Mail!, all to no avail. Still though, SiS did it the way it should be, no really bad words, and it was romantic, but to shove literal bathroom humor into a movie that wants to make history (like SiS did) or entertain us, or make one want to watch it over and over again. Keep it clean, use the proven track record of movies in the past that succeeded without having to resort to lowering its standards to appeal to today's internet types. Above all, NEVER, EVER have Rosie O. in any of your movies... :) (I had to say it)<br />Anyway, Slow Learners wasn't all bad, it had some definite funny parts, the two dorky nerds in the book club were the best, they had some genuine comedic lines that made me laugh out loud several times. There were also a few others in this that I liked and did a pretty good job with their parts.<br />Hopefully the two main stars in this movie will get better parts, or learn to act, or something, I don't hate their acting, only in this movie, and I am sure that there will be those that would like this and not see it the way I did, but that's is how I saw it... Maybe I'll see them in another movie and I'll eat my words, I really hope so.<br /><br />I would give this 2-1/2 stars though if I could, but I can't using  Amazon's rating system.ere is no need to say all of the stuff they said, especially that many times, and I promise, I say those words myself, but for me, in a romantic comedy they should not be raunchy.

"I really loved this movie.  Brenda Blethyn is one of my favorites, especially in her series, Vera.  Hillary Swank is great, and should have received better recognition for her work,especially in the movie, The Homesman.<br /><br />Is it possible that this movie, Mary and Martha  received little attention because it deals with real life and really tough problems?The same could be said of the movie,  The Homesman.  It dealt with people's lives in truly difficult times and conditions.  Maybe we just fail to appreciate talent when it presents to us the gritty aspects of human existence.<br /><br />The story of Mary and Martha allows us a close insight to the grief of personal loss, suffered by each of these two remarkable women.  None of us enjoy sorrow, or tragic loss of a young person.  Stories such as this help us somehow to understand such loss apart from our own heartaches.<br /><br /> I am glad this story was based on a real Martha and her real son, Harry, who died of malaria while working with children in Africa.  I wish the Martha character had been given a more active part in the development of the story for television.  Time constraints have to be considered.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for all,especially women.",5,True
Not a thriller. Tension is built.

"Because Creative Galaxy and Tumble Leaf have been moderately good, I thought we'd give Wishenpoof a try even though I was already turned off by the image of a waif-ish thin girl with the teensiest button nose.  It's a shame that we can't do for girl characters what we do for boys - just make them engaging, likable and confidently solving problems and exploring and interacting with the world.  Instead girlhood is depicted like its a problem to be overcome with some belief in yourself and effort.  This is NOT a helpful message but comes off as an assumption that all girls need some sort of remediation from being girls. When the character of Bianca breaks into a ballad within each episode it would be nice if her singing voice actually sounded like a child's and not a grown woman's. Again, confusing and invalidating to young girls.",2,False

There were two other ladies in London doing this, too...and way too many orphanages in the U.S. allowing children to die, either of disease or starvation.

These 3-5 minute films give just enough information to introduce the viewer to the problem & solution, and they leave the viewer wanting to learn more about science.

Another great film is &#34;The Secret of Trees.&#34;  We are amazed how a 13-year old invented a way to harness solar energy by aligning solar panels in the same pattern as leaves on trees.  The leaves follow the  Fibonacci Sequence, a recurring mathematical formula in nature.  Yet another is &#34;You don't know Jack.&#34;  This film showcases the research by another teenager who is fervently working on developing a cure for pancreatic cancer.

Its not nearly as deep as it claims to be, and really the entire plot is a long-winded whine. The acting is quite good throughout, especially Bill Hader. However the storytelling is so contrived. Its as if whomever made this movie first sat down with the title in mind, came up with an entire movie based on the title, and never really went further than adding obvious symbolism. At the end I could only think, &#34;Does this story really need to be told?&#34; It's the kind of plot you'd find from that boring co worker who complains about every facet of his dull life.

"░░░░░A GOOD MESSAGE░░░░░<br /><br />This movie came out of a time in Hollywood where the fashionable thing to do was to cram as many stars into a movie as possible, each with relatively small parts and no real leading actor. Then they would sell the movie to audiences based on the star appeal rather than the content of the film. Most of this genre stunk something awful. (I'm looking at you, New Year's Eve) But Love Actually really delivers. It's an anomaly.<br /><br />It is still a bunch of actors crammed into small roles with a loosely connected story line.<br /><br />But the theme of each mini story is the same, that love is strong and takes on many different forms. You can love your wife, love your best friend, love your family, love a girlfriend, love someone you cant' have, love someone you can have, love your kids, love your country, etc etc etc. Some love is easy and fun (The Prime Minister and his girlfriend) some love is hard (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's marriage) and some love is down right painful (Laura Linney caring for a mentally ill brother).<br /><br />Each story comes back to that theme in the end, that no matter what else is going on in life and no matter how bad the world seems, there is love all around us. It's everywhere, and it's not hard to find. All you have to do is open your eyes to look for it.<br /><br />However, count me on the side of people who think that Andrew Lincoln's character was WAY out of line to go to Keira Nightly's house shortly after she's married to Lincoln's best friend to profess his undying love for her. That's not sweet. That's not cool, man. That's some low down home wrecking stuff there. People are split 50/50 on this scene. Some people think it's really sweet. But the truth is that he's unburdening his soul at the risk of damaging his best friend's marriage. That's not good. That's selfish.",5,False

"In PETTY ROMANCE director Kim Jung-hoon takes a standard romantic pairing of potential lovers to establish the oddly compelling parameters of success in the adult comic trade.  Jeong Bae (Lee Sun-kyun) is a struggling artist in the manga (called &#34;manhwa&#34; in Korea) world of sex and violence comic books. He learns of a contest with a first prize of $100,000 USD. The only problem is that Jeong Bae needs a script writer to complement his artistic skills. He interviews various candidates, all of whom do not exactly fit into his scheme of a hero who can combine manga type sex and violence into a winning formula.  Enter Han Da-rim (Choi Kang-hee) whose own sleazy background is acceptably graphic. The romance of the film begins with the inevitable bickering between her vision of a hero and his. She sees Jeong Bae as one who is locked into a losing image of commercial manga art whereas he sees her as too graphic (if one can be so in manga) to work with. Much of PETTY ROMANCE is replete with manga style animation with a stylized female assassin fetchingly clad as she slices and dices her way through legions of hapless victims.  There is little doubt however that this bickering will by the closing credits lead to a satisfying climax of personal and professional success. There is nothing petty about PETTY ROMANCE. The leads bounce off each other in ways that seem somehow real despite the unreality of their linking professions.  One can sense that PETTY ROMANCE is a fine example of a Hollywood style romance of the 1930s that is just as entertaining today in Korea as Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn were in their heyday.",4,True

Lucien was a brilliant sociopath and whoever played him did a marvelous job as well. It's not an action packed movie, despite being about a murder, but it's cerebral and an interesting glimpse into the lives of these iconic people.",3,True

"This first full-length feature from writer/director Talya Lavie presents a unique take on conscripted service into the IDF from a female perspective. The result is a Heller-esque tale replete with absurdities and inanities of military servitude.  It took a woman to tell this story.  Unlike other military movies, this one is almost entirely female - other than two smaller parts that come to mind, girls rule here.<br /><br />Lavie's script stitches together three loosely connected tales: &#34;01: The Replacement&#34;; &#34;02: The Virgin&#34; and &#34;03: The Commander&#34;. The constant in the three stories is the presence of Dana Ivgy as Zohar. Ms. Ivgy is a personal favorite dating back to [[ASIN:B000255L98 Broken Wings]]. She's a great actress and an arresting on screen presence even when dressing down or meant to be bristly and difficult like she is here.  Ivgy shines brightest in Lavie's 2nd story as the title character.<br /><br />The movie' surprise, though, is Nelly Tagar as Daffi.  She plays a big part in the first story, ostensibly training her replacement as she angles for reassignment in Tel Aviv. Tagar is a naturally gifted physical comedienne with fun, expressive eyes.  Her ability to cry on contact plays a big part in the story and to watch her to do it with aplomb -- and have you chuckle at the results -- is a real treat.  I was saddened to see her not appear n the second tale, but excited to see her return in the third and finale story, whose title -- The Commander -- is a neat little head fake from Lavie.<br /><br />The third star turn in the film is that of Shani Klein as Rama, a commander and boss to Zohar and Daffi.  I really liked Ms. Klein in this role.  Her Rama is a thin sheen of bluster with a sensitive core underneath. Zohar doesn't see it, but the audience can.",4,True

There are no interviews with police, firemen, paramedics or witnesses, a riot occurs and only one camera is out to record it. Hundreds of other cell phones stay in pockets, no one tweets or post to social media. The characters must be on a plan with no data, no text and very limited minutes because they only call on occasion and don't bother to convey any useful information. When bit the victims seem content to sit and die if there is no answer on 911. To summarize the social and civil milieu is not remotely believable.

"Generally speaking, this is an original plot and, despite the unlikely premise of advanced aliens surviving in the form of spores that can mate/hybridize with human DNA, pretty realistic and very gripping.  My biggest and minor complaint about the realism is when they had Molly supposedly hitting 4 bullseyes with the pistol after never having fired one before.  The characters, including that of Ethan the Android Humanich son , JD the former cop, and .Molly Woods (played by Halle Berry), the former astronaut and now hybrid, are all interesting.        After watching all 11 episodes of Season 2, I am even more impressed than after season 1.  Several actors/actresses and their characters were very engaging.  The projections of future technology in Extant ,which appears to be at least 20 years into the future,such as even more ubiquitous surveillance and recording of everything and the quantum leap in AI were all believable.  The intelligence shown by the World Threat Assessment master computer and the humanichs--androids with the very nearly exact appearence of humans--is very impressive but not so extreme as to be ridiculous or even highly unlikely.  I liked the profile of the hybrid human-aliens as being generally peaceful but with some hostility to humans.  The escape of the alien spores containing the DNA of an alien race about to be wiped out from some unspecified global catastrophe and then by infecting/mating with humans--is a pretty imaginative mutation on the familiar Superman/Supergirl escape from Krypton.   Among the more progressie,non-male-chauvanist high points in character development, was the roughly 60 year-old woman Secretary of HomeSec, the future Dept. of Homeland Security, Fiona Stanton, played by Kate Burton, who was an earthy, tough boss every bit as intimidating as a macho male boss would be, yet a fair person.  While there may be a minor problem with some perhaps gratuitous sex thrown in such as in the ubiquitous cleavage displayed by Berry, which is a good hook for heterosexual males, Berry succeeds in evoking a wide and deep range of emotion, ranging from wisecracking to extreme anger and irespressible independance to great sadness and affection.  Although JD Richter, the detective and on-demand cop played by J Dean , was initially a bit off-putting with his loose sexual behavior, he  progressively is shown to be a very good and honest human being with courage and whose &#34;problem with authority&#34; helps Molly to be able to escape from the federal /global authorities trying to stop her from figuring out and revealing how the alien invasion/landing has inadvertantly led to what looks like murders of young pregnant women.  His down-to-earth detective skills is a realistic and welcome departure from all the cyber-sleuthing that is the predominant form of investigation/intelligence in this future world.",5,True

"Worth watching for Fiennes' performance. He is as compelling as he would go on to be in Schindler's List and the remake of Red Dragon.  Binoche is less successfully cast as Cathy. French accent gets in the way and her part could have been better written. The wonderful Janet McTeer is wasted on this Nelly Dean, reduced here to a bit of a cipher. If you really want the full Wuthering experience, McTeer's reading of the book available on Audible is not to be missed.  The book is hellishly difficult to capture well on film. It is much darker, and the psychology of the characters much more complex, than even this version conveys, and it does try. Some have praised the music. I thought it cliched, over the top and intrusive.",3,True

The humor was cruder, more sexual, and there was a lot of F-bombs, 58 to be exact. The film also allowed itself to draw some similarities to the original vacation, such as the girl in the car, but didn't over do it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appeared near the end which was a bit anti-climatic. The best humor came when they did a misdirection from the formula. Perhaps the biggest laugh was provided by the family car.<br /><br />Guide:  Plenty of swearing, sex talk, brief nudity.",4,True

Bruce Willis, too, played his spoof-part with tongue-in-cheek gusto.  By the way, Tom Mix was one of the pallbearers at Wyatt Earps funeral - he was quite an admirer of Mr. Earp.  If you are a James Garner fan, as obviously I am, I think you'll enjoy this movie.  Oh ... another &#34;plus&#34; - if you are an antique car fan, the automobiles in this movie are absolutely pristine in their quality and appearance.

Keep in mind that the producers had high hopes for Blue, but didn't know how much of a hit (if at all) it would be.  So the introductions are slightly different at first, the cutaways are a continually evolving art form, the music is a bit more strident and some of the character interactions are a bit edgy.<br /><br />As you get deeper into the series you'll see that the finished product is a finely polished narrative with slice of life situations in every episode.<br /><br />NYPD Blue is the best cop series ever.",5,True

"I was assigned to watch this show for a Developmental Psychology class and, while I was a little reserved about the whole thing at the start, I was pleasantly surprised by the end. I loved how this amazing lady handled all those difficult and varied situations. She does not have a one-size-fits-all method, she actually listened and used what made sense. Also it was great to see  the focus wasn't truly on the children, but the parents.<br /><br />I recommend this show for anyone really, struggling parents and students aside, it gives you insight into other worlds and just how lucky you might be growing up in the family you did.",5,True

"A worth while rental, not something I would purchase again. It's plot is good, I only played the video game once or twice for a few minutes. I don't know how closely they follow each other but it is a good standalone movie. I live in Pennsylvania and I am knowledgeable about coal fires and deserted towns that are trapped in time on the day they were evacuated. I have to believe that this story line pulls from the Centralia Mine Fire, which was started by the ignorance of the townspeople. Overall worth a few bucks and a few hours of your day. I'm not a horror movie fan and I appreciate that they don't try and make you jump every three seconds by slamming doors or whatnot. The movie is able to tell a story that is interesting without cheap tricks.",4,True

"not a scary movie about stupid people. the premise is absurd. an affluent Manhattan couple own their apartment and can afford to send their 2 kids to a private school; in a city where parents will practically sell their souls and go to ridiculous lengths to get their kids into a good Manhattan private school; provided they can actually afford to do so.  One child nearly gets hit by a car and the parents go bonkers and start carrying on about how they have to get out of NY. Husband tells well paid corporate ladder climbing wife to take a leave of absence for a year; uh huh, likes they're really gonna hold that position open for her..........and like they're really going to take their kids out of an elite private school and send them to an upstate public school of.........lesser consequence.  somehow they're able to purchase a foreclosed estate, complete with baronial mansion (in excellent condition btw) , swimming pool, well over a thousand acres, the whole deal all for the low low price of $210,000. call now and well include a handy dandy weed whacker. I bet that property is worth between $3 to $5 million; no freakin way in upstate NY are you gonna touch a deal like that even in foreclosure for $210,000.00  the kids are smart, the parents are stupid, the wife is a completely clueless idiot. the painfully transparent low class, ex-con, conniving bs artist son of the previous owner worms his way into their home with great ease because the parents are incredibly stupid, but the kids are hip to his s***t and hate him.  father finally wakes up to reality and the con man quits knowing he'll get fired sooner than later. mother doesn't understand, maybe she's got the hots for bronzed, chiseled and sweaty pretty bad boys.  pretty boy is a dangerous psycho case of the first order and he's out to get this family because he feels the property is still his.  parents mishandle the entire situation from day one and get too chummy with the local tavern owners and play right into their hands.  this (obviously) does not end well.",2,False

This was the most forced, corny, laugh less movie I have ever seen. Relying on BAD slap stick and painfully obvious jokes, this movie is LAME. I was so embarrassed for Jenna, Harley, and Grace. You could tell they were just doing these two guys some friendly favor by being in this. Anyone who gave this movie a 5 is a mindless fan boy/girl, yeah you, you tasteless pandering puppets. Watch the movie Idiocracy and see what our future will be like if we keep patting idiotic efforts like this on the back.

A romantic concoction set in a different time having only the vaguest connection with the actual events that inspired it.

Excellent movie.  Cary Grant and Irene Dunne have great chemistry on screen and this story is so good.  But then again... I've never seen a bad Cary Grant movie.

Some cool special effects and interesting enough . Third season ridiculous. Continued to watch only out of a desire to finish what I started. The twists in plot speaks of a desperation by the writers to fill enough episodes to make a season.

"Whether you're a fan of Walking Dead or not, this show just isn't worth the time wasted watching it. There are inevitable comparisons to an original hit that make it tough for spin-off series, but in this case it seems like the production powers that be are the ones guilty of tying the show to the background knowledge of an experienced fan following rather than creating a solid vehicle that can stand on its own. That Fear the Walking Dead is a pale reflection of the original isn't the problem; it's just bad television! They go to the trouble of setting up this blended family story in episode 1, an unsubtle device used primarily to populate a multi-ethnic cast. That breaks down by episode 2, when the writers resort to a stereotype-driven story that divides the core characters and LA landscape in two--the violent, urban, Spanish-speaking inner city of looters and a nice, polite, white suburban neighborhood, where birthday parties come with a blow-up moon bounce even as the Apocalypse approaches. Despite the growling zombies and wailing sirens signaling civilization's fall, you can hear the main characters and minor victims all screaming &#34;youth demographic!!!&#34; The parents/kids-just-don't-understand bit repeats with every one of the too-many teens in the show--largely of the obnoxious variety. That includes the druggie black sheep Nick, the only actor in the cast of the living that seems to have a pulse, and Frank Dillane certainly turns in an energetic performance. He seems to have talent, so I presume it's the stinker of a script and direction responsible for a characterization that seems less starring role and more bad acting class exercise. You can almost hear a teacher giving the assignment to develop a Jekyll and Hyde-style mash-up of Jack Sparrow and the Mad Hatter as a drug addict. The only actual character that engaged my attention at all was the quiet, doughy Tobias, the geekster wizard who has seen the horrible future coming while spending too many overnight hours online, but even there the writers miss the mark. There's no way a kid like that would decide to trade a locked room and laptop for the &#34;safety&#34; of large numbers of high school peers whose humanity was in question even before zombies attacked! It's true that a certain amount of disbelief has to be suspended for a show like this to work, but there still has to be logic and consistency in the rules that do govern the world being created. Having Tobias come to school to be with more people, come all the way back later because the school was the best place he could think of to find a standard kitchen knife and canned goods, educate his teacher about the new way of the world, and then reject her offer to stay with her group in favor of isolation with a sometimes-around-uncle does NOT make any sense! Yet my preoccupation with that situation illustrates the essential problem with this show. Class, can we say booooooorrrrrriiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggg????? This show can't and shouldn't be the same kind of high-octane thrill that the original Walking Dead set off by having the lead character wake from a coma to join the Apocalypse already in progress. The backstory of those missing months is a natural curiosity guaranteed to draw people into the more intimate aspects of how it all started, but that's not what we're getting. The only thing viewers have to fear here is whether or not their snoring will wake the neighbors.",2,False

"I find that this series, like many of the BBC productions, is quite well done and well acted. The stories are interesting and the characters are well developed. It is important to watch the entire season and do so in order to best appreciate the development of the drama and the individuals.  I am struck by the general portrayal of policemen and women in both British and American TV.  Are they all really so consumed by their work that they have failed private lives? The three very strong female characters in this series do their jobs exceptionally well, but make poor choices in their private lives. It does add to their development, but I sometimes wish there would be a police character with a normal life. Perhaps Sgt. Saturday in Endeavor.",4,True

"I saw Dead Weight in 2012 and have been telling people about it ever since. Do I like it? I bought it twice, so yeah. After I walked by a table with a couple of guys selling their film, I was immediately captivated by the cinematography that was being shown on the 10 inch screen. This looked too well done for a project that didn't have a big studio behind it. Needless to say,  it was better than I thought.<br /><br />Dead Weight is a survivor movie more than a zombie film. With dark humor and a little romance, it surprised me with the connection I made with the characters which is in large part due to the writing and editing of the film. Unlike most post apocalyptic films, it is the journey of a group not only trying to survive starvation, the elements and other survivors but with a specific destination that keeps them going.  Specifically, Charlie who is going to make this destination no matter what in hopes of reuniting with his girlfriend Samantha.  With no confirmation that his girlfriend Samantha is even there, Charlie becomes obsessed and nothing will stop him. If you are an obstacle or defy the path, you're dead weight.<br /><br />Most horror stories focus on the monsters that are made by bug, bird or whatever outbreak the writers decide to develop. This film DOES have monsters and they are man made. The only difference is these monsters know how not to be monsters and still act less human than the things in the dark.<br /><br />John Pata and Adam Bartlett do a superb job of directing and writing with editing that is award worthy. I truly look forward to what these gentlemen will show us next. Joe Belknap does a fantastic job for a first time acting role.  Aaron Christensen, Michelle Courvais and Mary Lindberg give spectacular supporting performances as does the entire cast.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning,  this is a survivor movie.  Surviving the elements, surviving your fellow survivors, surviving exhaustion and ultimately yourself. I recommend DeadWeight as a superb horror drama.",5,False

I really wanted to like this movie.  I normally like Nicole Conn and the two lead actresses were fabulous, however the actual movie just made me mad.  I won't give away any spoilers if you want to still see this movie in which you should no matter what another feels about it.  You have to make that decision yourself, but from perspective this movie was anything but a Perfect Ending.  More like a perfect mess.",1,False

"It's rare to see a program about social workers and legal aid lawyers. Of course, we do have a parallel story about the world of corporate law to provide a comparison. This tale is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one of the rust belt cities suffering from loss of industry and high unemployment. It's bleak...pre &#34;The Wire&#34; , which is one of best portraits of social and economic decay ever written. This series does an excellent job of showing how the corporate world can wring profit from even the most dire of circumstances. It also does not whitewash the inadequacy of the social service system and the juvenile justice system to address the horrific consequences to children living in poverty. It's not a perfect series, but that's okay. It's the perspective that is important. I speak as one who served 30 years as a social worker in the public sector. Kudos to CBS for originally airing this glimpse into the world of social services and legal aid.",5,True

"Bought this phone from MetroPCS for about 100 out the door, and i have put it through a few paces. as a tech savvy device user, i felt compelled to post this review since all the other reviews i have run across seem to be from people that were paid to write them, and seem to ignore all the things that the general populace might want to know.<br /><br />The device at first encounter feels cheap. its fairly light for its size (4.9oz) most likely due to its all plastic construction. There's a slight amount of flex possible in the phone but it appears to handle it well.<br /><br />Button placement - Horrible - 1/5 HTC decided, for whatever reason, to put the power button, and the volume buttons on the same side (right side) of the bezel. they are in fairly close proximity to each other, so you will find yourself pressing the power button at times when you are trying to adjust volume. also the placement of the power button itself could not have been in a worse place. It rests about 2/3 of the way up the bezel, which conveniently, (or not so much so) is right where most people grab the phone when in use, thus causing you to constantly, inadvertently press the power button  and subsequently locking your phone in the middle of whatever you were doing. It also causes you to hit the power button while removing your phone from your pocket. ***MAJOR ANNOYANCE***<br /><br />Screen - Decent - 3/5. For a low/mid range device, the screen is adequate. The colors are pretty true, but the blacks look a bit more grey, than a true deep black. not a deal killer unless you are a videophile or just super picky about the black level on your device. it has an ips screen which allows viewing from extreme angles, without the image &#34;washing out&#34; or flipping negative&#34; it has a 720x1280  resolution with 294ppi density (for the nerds). the device has light sensing capability and for the most part, it does a good job keeping the screen view-able in most conditions. it also can get pretty bright if you use the manual back-light settings.<br /><br />Sound - HORRIBLE - 1/5. First off, HTC decided not to add the BOOM SOUND hardware to this device. It appears to have the signature HTC stereo front facing speakers, but in reality, the top speaker grill is only the earpiece speaker. The lower grill houses the loudspeaker which, at its highest setting, is only marginally loud in a quiet setting. and if you work, or happen to be located somewhere where there is background noise, you can pretty much forget the speakerphone, or listening to music without headphones. Consequentially, ringer volume also suffers, and i have had several instances where i have missed calls or notifications because i simply didn't hear the thing ring. Even in my pocket. Aftermarket &#34;super loud&#34; ringtones help a bit, but....<br /><br />Software - HTC Sense 7 UI. Its HTC Sense. what can you say. the lock screen sucks. its not customizable with widgets or anything useful. it comes with a big basic clock with weather, and the basic dock icons at the bottom which allows you to choose what function you want to unlock into. ie, phone contacts messages internet, and there aren't any options to modify this configuration that i have located as of this posting. also the pattern (9 dots) is quite small compared to the available screen space making it more likely to make an error while inputting your security pattern code.<br /><br />vibration - 2/5 - Weak at best. could miss it, even in your pocket.<br /><br />STORAGE - Marginal / low - 2/5. The device touts 8 gig of storage, but alas, after the OS and bloatware go on, the end user is left with somewhere around 3.75 gigs of space to play with. For a sub $100 device, it could be considered acceptable, but there really needs to be something done with manufacturers misrepresenting ROM, as if the advertised space is truly whats available to the end-user. Supposedly, the new Lollipop version of android includes the capability to WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, but using the latest ES file explorer, i still have difficulty writing files and creating folders on the external sd. But thats not the manufacturers fault its Android. but it needed to be said. Get an external card adapter if you want to add your music or movie collection to the sd card, as i have attempted to lan transfer files to the ext sd, and some larger files ended up corrupted, or disappeared altogether after a reboot.<br /><br />Processor speed - 3/5. Again This is a sub $100 device but the decision to include a Snapdragon 210, instead of a SD410 baffles me. the device experiences some lag switching between apps, unlocking, and pretty much any type of multitasking events attempted. it doesn't totally kill the experience, but if you are used to snappy switching between apps, you will notice the lag time. Playing a full 1080p trailer from internal memory resulted in a slightly choppy, but not unwatchable video.<br /><br />Calls - 4/5 Haven't really had any complaints making and receiving calls using the handset, although i have heard that the speakerphone function sounds muffled at times<br /><br />Cameras. Fairly decent. with the HDR mode, you can get some pretty clear pics. the included picture was taken at dusk, with no flash, in HDR mode. Video appears to be of a decent quality, and there is a rear facing mic to capture sound<br /><br />Durability. ?/5 - it has been dropped, several times. A couple times on corners, and with the exception of a minor ding or 2, the device seems to be<br />none the worse. Not sure what material the screen is made of but it seems to scratch fairly easy, as i have a slight scratch or two that i still dont know where they came from. (not from dropping it) possibly something in my pocket, but my device always has its own pocket, so i don't know. only time will tell how well this device holds up to the rigors of a rough and tumble environment. And i purchased the white one specifically so i could see what surface wear was occurring, and how being handled with oily hands and being in a dusty shop affects the outer shell<br /><br />Battery Life - 3/5 - The device ships with a NON-REMOVABLE 2000mah battery which in my opinion, is too small of a battery to be in a device with a 5 inch screen. leaving the screen on and/ or using high brightness mode, you can practically watch the battery level go down. with moderate usage, you can make it through the day without having to charge, but if you do a lot of social media or watching videos, you might want to keep a charger handy. on another note, the device charges fairly quickly, so the trade off is marginal, IF you have a charger with you. there is also a power saving mode, and an extreme power saving mode that turns off almost all the advanced functions, leaving only basic functionality, but greatly extends your battery life. In an emergency, it could be the difference between a dead phone, and still having basic communication.<br /><br />Bluetooth. - 4/5 - paired to my bluetooth helmet fairly easily. plays music and takes phone calls. The volume was lower than my previous device in the helmet speakers.<br /><br />Wifi. -5/5 connected and held the connection for a decent distance away from the router. haven't had any issues with disconnects or authentication problems.<br /><br />Sim Card and Micro sd card slots are located on the left edge, under a plastic door. the device supposedly supports up to 200 gig of sd expansion, although i have never seen a 200gb micro sd card.<br /><br />Root - ? - As of this posting, there isn't any publicly known method to root this device.<br /><br />Overall - 3/5 - This device is more suited for a casual user, that wants smartphone capability. The basic functions operate well enough. but if you want or need a snappy response or you are a power user, this device may not be for you. Dont get this device confused with the HTC 626, which specs out at 16gigs of onboard memory and has an 8Mp camera insteadof a 5Mp and has the SD410 chip versus the SD210.",3,True

"Let's see..... a dome suddenly appears, separating me and my family from the rest of the world.  First, I head to every sporting goods store and stock up on firearms and ammunition.  I buy bows and arrows.  Hunting knives.  Camp stoves.  Batteries of every shape and size -- including every car battery I can afford.  I then find the nearest Walmart and start stocking up on canned and dried goods, not to mention all the other day to day stuff one would like to have on hand.  There is more I would do.....but what do these people do?  Explore the wall....wonder about split cows and crashed planes, and wander in circles.<br /><br />This show is a train wreck of bad writing.  But I just keep watching, wondering what weird direction some character will take in the next episode.  First, Jr. is a sociopath who chains is girlfriend up in a bomb shelter to &#34;save&#34; her.  Now he's a hero.  First, Big Jim is a good guy trying to keep things together, then he's a councilman supporting a drug dealer, then he's just an idiot.  Now he's a sociopath. Big Jim actually expresses more multiple personalities than most criminals trying to use a multiple personality defense.  Every character in this show is all over the place.  We never know what personality trait a character might develop next.<br /><br />Strangely enough, the acting is great, and the underlying story line seems solid (as I'd expect with Stephen King), it's just that each episode seems to have forgotten what the last set forth.  I'm astounded crap like this gets three or four seasons when extremely well written shows barely survive a year.

"This was the first time I heard of this movie, or the book by the author. But the story rings true for a reason I will discuss shortly. I have produced a 4 hour DVD entitled ... VIETNAM BETRAYAL AND TREASON that is on YOUTUBE. It explains how our government planned this war in at least 1945; how our top brass trained Ho Chi Minh and his guerilla army prior to the war starting; why we were not allowed to win it; how those missiles in the movie were sent to Vietnam by Russia; how our government allowed American business permission to sell WAR MAKING TECHNOLOGY to Russia which was supplying 80 % of the technology to North Vietnam [ by the way, this is easily documented by U S GOVERNMENT REPORTS, which you will see in the DVD;. ]  and lastly: how one American, not in the military nor in the government, with the later support of two retired military officers, FORCED RICHARD NIXON ... TO END THE WAR ... YEARS BEFORE IT WAS SCHEDULED TO END!!! This is hard to believe ... but .... IT IS TRUE. I name names and make the required accusations in this DVD and then comment that America owes these three patriotic and courageous Americans who figured out how to win the war ,,, a HOORAY!!!!!!

"Every year around 9/11 I watch several documentaries on September 11 because I, like many Americans was totally fixated by watching this tragedy unfold in the media.  I remember exactly where I was when this occurred and how I and my family dealt with it. It is so important that we as a nation never forget this poignant part of our history as those who ignore history are destined to repeat it.  I saw this film when it originally aired on CBS in 2002.  It was incredible to watch then and it still is incredible to watch so many years later.  I purchased the video over a decade ago because it was such a meaningful record of what occurred that day in NYC.  It is a totally different perspective of 9/11 and gives you a sense of how this affected those first responders.  After watching the film you begin to really understand what it means to be a NY firefighter.  By chance these filmmakers just happened to be in the right place at the wrong time.  However, I am thankful they tasteful complied this historical record and gave a sense of the deep tragedy which we all know as September 11th.  You think after a decade you have seen all you possibly can about 9/11 documentaries, then you realize this is THE documentary which truly summarizes how Americans felt on that day.  At the end, pictures are shown of all the firemen who perished In the towers and as I was watching I kept thinking .....when are these photos going to end? How long is this going to be? There are more photos...over and over.....it is riveting.  A must see for every American.",5,True

"Martin (Brian Morvant) is a PTSD veteran whose dog was just killed. He lives in a cabin by the lake and informs his brother not to come up, which means his psychologist/counselor brother Ed (Dean Cates) and alcoholic sister Lyla (Lauren Ashley Carter) drive up to help the &#34;Maine-iac.&#34; They find Martin talking wildly wielding a gun babbling about a killing soldier called a &#34;pod.&#34; He claims he was part of an army experiment being fed pills etc. and that he had seen the pod. He has one trapped in the basement. Martin has shaved portions of his head and has even removed the &#34;tracking device&#34; in his tooth using a pliers. Ed believes Martin has had a relapse and needs help. Lyla buys into the far fetched tale.<br /><br />The acting on this film was solid. Brian Morvant did a crazy person that drove me crazy. Likewise Dean Cates and Lauren Ashley Carter seemed to have nailed their roles in this low budget film. The movie camera angle was mostly a first person angle giving the production a hand held camera feel, but without the jerking camera.

"We all love a great big robot with a throbbing piece (I meant a gun)and this film has them - by the bucket load - or is that `circuit board load?

They are here to study all life forms and have imposed a curfew on all humans - except the Quisling types who actively collaborate - led by a sneeringly objectionable Ben Kingsley.<br />** Plot Spoiler a bit further down**<br />People are monitored by some sort of electronic tag that alerts the nasty machines if you do anything naughty and they come after you. Well if you are caught doing anything these robots don't like then you are sort of vaporised. Then the heroes - all kids - discover how to turn their tags off (like some of the crims we currently do this to). Then off they go on their plucky way to reunite families, start a resistance and save the world!<br /><br />Is this any good though?

"Wanda Sykes' delivery reminds me of a gay and female Chris Rock.  But unlike him, nothing she says is cutting edge.  I'd even call her act hackneyed.

She either lacks basic knowledge or she's intentionally tailoring her act to her vapid white middle class audience..  (that's the kind version of what I was gonna say!)<br /><br />She does move on to other topics later in her special, but it just wasn't very good.  Ninety percent of her appeal is her deliver I think, because the actual stuff she was saying was pretty uninspired.  Once every five minutes she says something worthwhile, but god did I find her act tedius.  Perhaps if she didn't direct her standup to the kind of people that I really don't like, I'd be more receptive to her.  I had the same problem with Stephen Colbert.

"I just finished watching Season 3, or as it is now known, the final season of Hannibal, and I have to say it's a little bit heartbreaking. I've been a huge fan of this show since its first few episodes, and though it was hanging on by a thread in the ratings after Seasons 1 and 2, I was hopeful that its critical acclaim and rabid fanbase would be enough to keep it around until everybody else caught on. Unfortunately, that won't be the case and we'll never get to find out how amazing things could have been had the show been allowed to adapt The Silence of the Lambs. This season was divided into two halves, the first of which finished off the adaptation of the book Hannibal, and the second that focused solely on the novel Red Dragon. Accordingly, the first half of the season was pure gothic horror, bizarre, surreal, and disturbing. While several character outcomes were distorted or rearranged, it was more faithful to events in the book than the first two seasons while expertly substituting both Will Graham and Alana Bloom for Clarice Starling's parts. Then, the show became truly greater than it's ever been with the addition of Richard Armitage (The Hobbit's Thorin Oakenshield) as Francis Dolarhyde. The entire Red Dragon arc has been by far the closest the show has followed its source material, but the first two seasons have served to breathe new life into a story that has already been adapted to film twice before. The backstory and relationships between all of the principle characters give this story so much more vitality than it's ever had, it crushes me even more that they won't be able to do Silence of the Lambs. Sadly, the show never had the rights to that novel, but had hopes that they'd be attainable somewhere along the line. Since it never happened, they used Graham and Bloom in place of Starling in the first half of the season, then Bloom again in the final episode. While only a brief nod to &#34;Lambs,&#34; Bloom comes to Hannibal with an offer from the FBI, one that facilitates his escape from prison. Although the reason for the offer and its outcome are far different from &#34;Lambs,&#34; it was an obvious allusion to Thomas Harris's most famous story. Instead, knowing that the show would not be resurrected by another platform, the last episode offers finality to both main characters, and closes the door on any future attempt to revive the series. Make no mistake, it was a beautifully tragic way to finish off the connection between Will and Hannibal, but it's bitterly disappointing to see it all come to an end. Thanks are in order to Bryan Fuller, the writers, and the enthralling actors that made this show such a masterpiece. The only consolation is knowing that Will and Hannibal will not only be together forever, but will both provide one last meal before they depart. And in that regard, they will always have a leg up on poor, shattered Bedelia.<br /><br />*Edit- After the finale, Bryan Fuller stated in an interview that Martha Stewart of all people is trying to get financing to back a Hannibal feature film, likely as a TV mini-series. He seems very enthusiastic to finish off his vision of Hannibal and Will, suggesting that they survive their fall, ala Sherlock Holmes. While I'm hopeful, I just don't see it happening, but he mentioned Bedelia hiding her fork at the end of the finale, a possible clue that Hannibal is still alive.

I had a great time .. didn't binge watch, but close.<br /><br />In some cases, there is a real character arc that builds real human empathy in certain roles; I liked that a lot.

"From just watching the Pilot: I like the premise and potential here, but the cinematography and visual storytelling pale in comparison to the original Walking Dead.  The original walking dead communicates so much more with less shots and tighter script.  There are also a plethora of cheap false scares that just have that been done feel, tho there are some good moments.  Several moments too are &#34;scary because the music is telling you it's scary&#34; not complementing what is going on screen, this is a cheap technique.  One of the biggest things for me too is the episode feels WAY too stretched for the material being presented.  May have been better edited down to half it's current length even.  I was finding myself ready for scenes to end and wanting to move on.  I HOPE that as it goes it's refined to take some of the better film making tips from it's sister show as well as develop it's own original take or angle to this fascinating world.",3,False

"The film opens with pictures of the director on the beach and moves into the Roman's sacking Jerusalem.  The narrator reads a French translation of Josephus's account, the Roman's speak in English, and the Israeli's speak Hebrew.  The key idea is that the Jews were fighting viciously for their freedom.  This is the theme of the film: Israel now finds itself fighting war after war that nobody wants and that everyone recognizes to be necessary for freedom.  There isn't a traditional story line but a series of scenes that work backward from soldiers reluctantly preparing for a recent incursion into Lebanon through scenes from other wars to the director describing to the cast his own experiences in the Yom Kippur war.  Some of these scenes are choreographed like a ballet; I particularly liked the scene where the director is talking to the Arab owner of service station near the border where he has arranged to meet his son, back from the front.  The director and owner speak in succession but never address each other and always move in opposite directions.  I also liked the layering of scenes simultaneously to convey persistence through multiple time periods.  Ultimately, the film settles on a woman we infer to be the director's mother, now dead.  We see some of her experiences in past wars, and we hear letters she wrote to her granddaughter, now in her 30s.  This woman was born in Europe and educated there.  Yet, she realized that, despite its successive wars, Israel was the only place she could be free and she counsels her granddaughter to love and experience the world.<br />This is not an easy film to watch.  Apart from its raw content, no characters are identified and there is no story line.  It is left to the viewer to piece together who these people are and what their relationships are to each other.  Still, it is well worth watching.  Don't be misled by other Amazon reviews.",4,True

Before spending an hour and a half on this, it would be a good idea to read the wikipedia article on it, and the Trivia section in imdb, which explain what's going on here. This is sort of the French equivalent of mumblecore. The author and his friends get together and play off each other (the film is not scripted). It's full of in-jokes, only one of which we happened to get (Houellebecq repeatedly reads Diderot's novel The Nun, which was the subject of an earlier film by the same director). If you're a big fan of Houellebecq, you'll probably &#34;get&#34; the movie, but we weren't and we didn't.",1,False

Also I did have a hard time deciphering the end game plan, almost like a scene was missing.  When the posse has the entity in the pool, I thought they were going to run their game plan which is all around the pool.  (Being vague here to avoid spoilers) which they didn't.  Mostly the movie was panic, running and making one bad decision after another scenes.  I'm not sure what I would have done different, but side note: This really reminded me of the Extremely long death with a highly inefficient weapon video on YouTube only with way more boobs.  It's an ok watch, but it's not The Ring in the scare the crap out of you class.",3,False
"Ann Burden (Margot Robbie) and her dog have managed to survive the nuclear holocaust due to the topography of her land and using common sense in dealing with contamination. She meets up with John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who has a Geiger counter and a type A protective suit on steroids. He suggests making a generator using hydro-electric power from the water falls. However, in order to do this he would have to take apart the church her father/preacher build. If you happen to look at the DVD cover or movie poster then you know Chris Pine also shows up and the description say &#34;emotionally charged love triangle&#34; which is a not exactly a plot spoiler, but he does come late into the film. If there was some way to watch the film having never seen the poster, or knowing he shows up, that would be the way to do it. As for me, I kept waiting for him to show up which made the film go slow with anticipation. So if you are planning a showing, hide the DVD cover.<br /><br />The title comes from a kids book Ann has on the Bible. John opens the book and sees &#34;A is for Adam.&#34; One would conclude what &#34;Z&#34; would be, as there is a hint and some talk that coating the world with radioactive contamination was part of the plan or at least Ann's survival. The book of Zachariah, talks about the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple as a juxtaposition to the discussing to tearing down the church. The survey of Chris Pine was correctly done as he assumed the industry standard position of Jesus on the cross.<br /><br />The acting was good and then there was Chris Pine. The film moved slow. For people who want to watch an end of the world film with some minor religious discussion, the notion God will save a few people for his plan, and no zombies then this is it. Please note, there is a latency period of &#34;puking&#34; and general sickness when one is exposed to radioactivity. The latency period depends on the amount of exposure from a week to immediately.

"Set in the 1960s at an all girl school we meet Lydia (Masie Williams) who has a best friend in Abbie. They have it all as friends and a love of nature centring around an old oak tree. They have a mixed bag of teachers who seem to adhere to Victorian values and modesty principles - that is despite the burgeoning `summer of love'.<br /><br />Then tragedy happens and Masie starts to have fainting fits - very soon the phenomenon spreads and she seems to be at the centre of it. Throw in a mum with issues (Maxine Peake) and a bit of the Occult, forbidden sex and deep rooted paranoia and you have the makings of a rather good story.<br /><br />Maxine Peake is billed starring here, but she is not really on screen for a great period of time; Greta Scacchi as the dowdy Miss Mantel is though pure excellence in a performance dripping with understatement. I have seen comparisons to `Picnic at Hanging Rock' and even the events around Salem and the subsequent Witch trials. However, I think such comparisons may lead to expectations that may not be met. It is though a film that had a great idea and I think it could have been taken much further as it sort of peters out; despite that it is still on I can recommend.",4,True

"First let me start by saying I read all the books as fast as they were published and several more than once.  So I was very happy to see that a series was being made. Though also a bit worried as it is tough to put everything that a book holds into a movie/series. I thought I was buying Season 1, turned out to be half of Season 1. I did not pay for the HD version as I was not sure that I would like it or not. The standard version was fuzzy and appeared to be downgraded. It appears that the person who cast the actors did not read the books, or perhaps there just was not anyone who fit the part of Jamie?  I am disappointed that the author agreed on the actor who plays Jamie (And I know from other reviews that I am not alone.). The actors who play Claire and Jamie are good, but the chemistry that is supposed to be between them is missing. Maybe some of the fiery looks that should be exchanged between them were edited out?  Jaime is supposed to be a tall red haired warrior and I apparently cannot get over the fact that the actor who plays him is not. But it seems one is always disappointed in something when a book is made into a movie. Nothing can match our imaginations. Personally I was hoping for a bit more romance than British brutality to be portrayed.",2,True

"Gunther takes the macabre, mysterious and taboo subject of death, dying and the deep inner workings of the human body to a whole new level with powerful graphic up-close demonstrations using real human cadavers, some frozen for precise surgical bandsaw slicing and others recently deceased for highly precise and rapid dissection demonstrations by Gunther that makes these complex topics easily understandable to adults with the stomach and openness to learn about such things through such actually real graphic visuals. However, these shows are not for children or the squeamish as the demonstrations are extremely graphic and close up.  Gunther is obviously an &#34;Uber&#34; elite expert anatomist and is extremely and precise with the tools of his trade, e.g. with the surgeon's scalpel, bone saws and large surgical bandsaws. The human body is an amazing piece of coordinated machinery, and the people that donated their bodies to Gunther for scientific educational purposes should be commended. Gunther is highly respectful of the donated cadavers and takes much expressed effort to preserve their dignity. I hope the show continues.",5,True

"Queen of Earth is a film that I had to sit with for 24 hours to try and gather my thoughts and even as I’m writing this, I’m still struggling to find the words to describe how I feel about it. I’ll start off by saying that I absolutely loved what I saw. Queen of Earth is a beautiful, breathtaking, intense, spellbinding, edge of your seat, physiological horror/thriller. This film relies mostly on dialogue and facial expression to build the tension and it does it to perfection. I loved the look and feel of this film which is very much a throwback to the 70s; the grainy look really works well here. Elisabeth Moss is absolutely mesmerizing in this film and at this moment is my choice for Best Lead Actress. The slow mental breakdown that Catherine is going through is rather chilling and Moss’s facial expressions alone tell a lot of the story. I really wish I could write a better review for this film because it deserves one, but I just can’t at the moment. I’m sure Queen of Earth is a film I’ll be revisiting a few times in the near future.",5,True

"From the series “The Jazz Life, Volume 1”, produced by pianist/singer Ben Sidran, comes these performances by two renowned jazz artists at the world famous jazz club, the Village Vanguard, located at the corner of 7th and 11th in Greenwich Village, NYC.  It begins with a session by the &#34;Little Giant” of the tenor saxophone, Johnny Griffin, and his quartet. This is followed by a performance by the Richie Cole Quintet on a separate date. The Vanguard has been one of the most famous jazz clubs in the world in terms of its history, the many performances there by the ‘best of the best’ in jazz, and the treasured live recordings. This reviewer has been there on many Saturday nights, Sunday afternoons, and Monday nights over 3 decades.  The Cole quintet appearance appears to be on a Sunday afternoon from Cole’s comments.<br /><br />The Griffin quartet includes the resourceful Kenny Washington on drums, Ray Drummond’s solid contrabass work, and the remarkable Ronnie Mathews on piano (mistakenly identified in ‘closed captioning’ as “Lonnie”). The video begins in the middle of a blazing uptempo Mathews piano solo, as the film shows exterior street scenes and the prominent awning over the entrance to this famous basement jazz club. The song is a blazing uptempo tribute to Babs Gonzalez, “Blues for Gonzie”, that gives way to Griffin’s inventive and humorous solo which is loaded with ‘quotes’ from “Dixie” to “Rhapsody in Blue”, showing his circular breathing prowess in the process, and ending with a furious sax-drum exchange. “A Monk’s Dream” has a marvelous solo piano intro by Mathews and a powerful solo from Griffin that includes a “Swinging on a Star” quote, with the entire performance receiving a loud ovation from the audience.<br /><br />Cole’s quintet includes the “Wild Man” Bobby Enriquez on piano, the superbBruce Forman on guitar, Marshall Hawkins on double bass, and Scott Morris on drums. The session begins with a supercharged version of Randy Weston’s jazz classic “High Fi” presented as a mambo and featuring great solos, then Cole salutes club owner Max Gordon with the standard ballad “I’ll Can’t Get Started” with a great “Oh, You Beautiful Girl” quote. The humorous “The Punishment Blues”, dedicated to &#34;criminals and creeps&#34;, is laced with cymbal splashes, booming bass, and a raunchy Cole solo, with great altissimo alto sax effects, got a standing ovation. “Yardbird Suite” gets a rousing performance with Enriquez' dazzling single lines, occasionally playing &#34;col pugno” with his fists, palms, and elbows while making perfect muscial sense, and a sizzling solo from guitar master Forman. Live jazz from an historic club by 2 masters of the art. My Highest Recommendation. Five FIERY Stars! (Amazon Instant Video, Color, SD quality, Produced by jazz pianist/singer Ben Sidran and directed by “Parker Y Bird” with excellent camera work.

The humorous “The Punishment Blues”, dedicated to &#34;criminals and creeps&#34;, is laced with cymbal splashes, booming bass, and a raunchy Cole solo, with great altissimo alto sax effects, got a standing ovation. “Yardbird Suite” gets a rousing performance with Enriquez' dazzling single lines, occasionally playing &#34;col pugno” with his fists, palms, and elbows while making perfect muscial sense, and a sizzling solo from guitar master Forman.

"Surprisingly, this exciting remake stays very true to Flemings first bond book of the same name - Casino Royale. Details have been changed. Bond is no longer fighting the Communists and Russians but is now facing terrorists. Baccarate was replaced with poker. But the essence and intention of the books shines through in this movie. Just as Fleming did with the original book, the movie paints a conflicted, thoughtful, and human bond. Casino Royale tells us in dramatic fashion how Bond became the charming, womanizing, cold blooded agent we have become so familiar with. Curiously no other director chose to tackle this more complex work of Fleming's until Craig's appearance. Perhaps we are now ready for a more sophisticated Bond? It seems Daniel Craig thinks so.",5,False

I love that the show deals with things like PTSD, homosexual rights, and strong women against a historical backdrop, and that Sidney Chambers is so complex.

He and Geordie are the best couple since Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin -- and of course it doesn't hurt that James Norton is drop-dead gorgeous.<br /><br />What I love most is that the show is sweet and kind without being cloying.

"Atmosphere, texture, and vibe save the day in We Are Your Friends, a rather daft, but often highly entertaining film set in the world of electronic dance music.  Zac Efron stars as Cole, an aspiring DJ dreaming of fame and fortune while living in a San Fernando Valley pool house, earning a modest living dealing drugs and cold-calling people in foreclosure at a shady real-estate firm.  He and his childhood friends (Jonny Weston, Shiloh Fernandez, Alex Shaffer) live fast and play hard to avoid recognizing their complacency and the resulting encroachment of mediocrity.  An encounter with a veteran producer (Wes Bentley) and his girlfriend slash assistant (Emily Ratajkowski), however, may represent a chance to ignite Cole's career in music if he can navigate and overcome a treacherous fusion of ambition, desire, and loyalty.<br /><br />Most of the drama here is on the contrived and predictable side.  Anyone who has ever watched a film knows Cole will sleep with his jaded mentor's girlfriend, and the secret will be revealed in time for a third-act confrontation.  There is also an eleventh-hour twist of tragedy; it rings false and seems harshly shoehorned in, as if a studio executive became nervous regarding the picture's otherwise largely cavalier attitude toward recreational drug use.  And despite the title, the friends are interchangeable bros and arguably the least interesting part of the film.<br /><br />Yet despite its flaws, We Are Your Friends is fun!  A quality which should not be undervalued.  First-time feature director Max Joseph recently completed a short documentary on the history of  DFA Records, the label co-founded by LCD Soundsystem mastermind James Murphy, and he infuses this film with a genuine respect for dance music, the technique required to create it, and the euphoria it can inspire.  He crafts the picture as an earnest, sentimental invitation to a mainstream audience to consider beats per minute, sampling, and the experience of standing in front of hundreds or thousands of people armed only with a laptop.  Joseph also proves an aggressive stylist, and the swirling visual experience—one drug-fueled party is depicted with psychedelic animation; hand-held cameras dart and zoom through thronging crowds of people gyrating and becoming one with the Day-Glo—and his heavy hand suits and elevates the content.<br /><br />There are also a trio of charismatic performers at the center of the story.  Efron, who I have long felt possesses a genuine movie-star magnetism beyond his initial claim to fame as a Mouse House heartthrob, is handsome, wide-eyed, and easy enough to invest in.  Bentley plays what could be an entirely antagonistic role in a sympathetic, almost haunted way; by refusing to twirl a proverbial mustache, he brings a degree of humanity to the aforementioned flawed-mentor arc/contrivance  And in one of her first acting roles, Ratajkowski, one of the most famous supermodels in the world at the moment due in part to her involvement in the &#34;Blurred Lines&#34; video, is not only incredibly sexy, but an authentic and warm presence.",4,True

The acting could be described by many words but I will just say horrible.

"MR ROBOT is smart, brave in its social commentary, well rounded and excellent in story telling.  Every character seems legit.  The two female leads are incredibly powerful--finally!  The sine qua non of Elliot and Angela's parents being killed by nefarious (Enron nodding) Evil Corp as motivation for their individual actions makes for a good revenge story.  But of course this story is expanded into a loftier scheme by the sheer force of an outlier's anger against the zeitgeist in the lone hacker in Elliot.  His scheming is motivated by astute aspergerian observations of the sufferings of the common man and the unfairness it represents generally--this is something to which nearly every pitiful, disenfranchized, merely-survivng pleb in modern society can easily relate.  MR ROBOT thus represents a new take on the antihero with heroic qualities.  As a linux user and web dev who immediately recognizes what hacking activities are being shown (routine linux commands), it's extremely refreshing to see a drama that represents hacking more realistically.  I love this show.  It is on par with breaking bad and better call saul.  There is only one problem with the show and it's the sound-editing.  There are parts that are far too loud for the dialogue, and it's intentional.  The grating tinnitus noise / drug / psychotic break noise is really overplayed by their sound engineers.",5,False

I also have a hard time believing two things:  that this was filmed in &#34;ultra hd&#34; and that it actually received halfway decent ratings on rotten tomatoes etc.  Who is rating this film - the friends of the less than amateurs who made this piece of crap?

"Ann Burden (Margot Robbie) and her dog have managed to survive the nuclear holocaust due to the topography of her land and using common sense in dealing with contamination. She meets up with John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who has a Geiger counter and a type A protective suit on steroids. He suggests making a generator using hydro-electric power from the water falls. However, in order to do this he would have to take apart the church her father/preacher build. If you happen to look at the DVD cover or movie poster then you know Chris Pine also shows up and the description say &#34;emotionally charged love triangle&#34; which is a not exactly a plot spoiler, but he does come late into the film. If there was some way to watch the film having never seen the poster, or knowing he shows up, that would be the way to do it. As for me, I kept waiting for him to show up which made the film go slow with anticipation. So if you are planning a showing, hide the DVD cover.<br /><br />The title comes from a kids book Ann has on the Bible. John opens the book and sees &#34;A is for Adam.&#34; One would conclude what &#34;Z&#34; would be, as there is a hint and some talk that coating the world with radioactive contamination was part of the plan or at least Ann's survival. The book of Zachariah, talks about the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple as a juxtaposition to the discussing to tearing down the church. The survey of Chris Pine was correctly done as he assumed the industry standard position of Jesus on the cross.<br /><br />The acting was good and then there was Chris Pine. The film moved slow. For people who want to watch an end of the world film with some minor religious discussion, the notion God will save a few people for his plan, and no zombies then this is it. Please note, there is a latency period of &#34;puking&#34; and general sickness when one is exposed to radioactivity. The latency period depends on the amount of exposure from a week to immediately.

This concert completely lacks energy and feels fake and contrived from start-to-finish. All of Perry's trademarks that propelled her to stardom are replaced by this pathetic, disconnected attempt to be a superstar diva, and it's just sad and boring.  Her first tour was joyful, fun, energetic, youthful, personal, and whimsical.  Here from the costumes to sets, and from her staged remarks to the bizarre and dull musical arrangements it's just a huge Vegas-styled opus of a disaster. If I had paid to go to this concert, I would have walked-out, confused by the person and presentation on stage.  The fans in the audience look equally confused and bored; they are forced to zoom in a a couple of die-hard fans but alas even their hearts are not in it. I hope Katy goes back to being herself soon before she becomes yesterday's news.  The world needs her former brand of carefree fun and wonder, not this attempt to be the next Beyonce, which isn't true to herself and which she will never be anyway.

"Objective Burma is one of those black and white war films that I would say is excellently directed.  Made in 1945 with Filipino actors that portray the Japanese Army in Burma, it is about as realistic as it could be filmed given the US was still in a shooting war with that nation.  The acting, direction and plot were all great.  Errol Flynn gives his usual tough guy performance as well as sharing his tender side which he did for the ladies that were watching this film.

This next criticism is leveled solely at Amazon, not the movie and does not factor into my rating. I would have been happier if I bought the Blu-Ray. Amazon's sound quality and volume continue to disappoint. I had to turn it up to nearly 90 to hear the dialogue and sound clearly. Sound is at least as important as visuals in a movie.

"There is a college community and Chace (Cameron White) is one of the students. He is taking literature after failing out of drama. He meets a number of interesting young ladies as he acts weird. There is also a local werewolf community that kills people, a community that came from the Vietnam Timber Wolf- not to ruin it for you, but Eric Roberts has a Vietnam flashback were he has long hair as an American Soldier and he sees a Vietnamese turn into a Timber Wolf.<br /><br />Now that I mention it, the werewolves are a head scratch. Sometimes they are just plain real wolves. Sometimes they are awkwardly moving CG wolves that look like regular wolves. Other times they are huge classic clay animation wolves.

"This is a great, fun, and informational show about all different species here on planet earth. I'm so happy my son has this wonderful show to engage him and get him thinking and caring about the different creatures we live with on planet earth. This is a great beginning to the journey of becoming a steward of the environment. The show begins with the Kratt brother's guiding the viewers through a short documentary on the animal being discussed, in their native habitat, and footage of the actual animal is always shown. After about 5 minutes, the show transitions into a cartoon, where the Kratt brothers, whom you just heard speaking about an animal, are in that same habitat. Along with their associates, they research the creature in order to develop suits that enable the Kratt brothers to run/swim/fly alongside the creature. The show incorporates a great group of characters that I think kids can relate to: a female Spanish speaking engineer,  a lovable surfer dude, a courageous and levelheaded female scientist, and the silly do-good Kratt brothers. There are also villains... A chef who always wants to cook endangered species, a fashion designer who wants to make endangered species into clothing, and their sidekicks.  The show is really good about showcasing lifecycles and helping kids understand the creature's value in the food chain. They make it exciting by highlighting the creature's strengths, calling them &#34;creature powers!&#34; Even though the protagonist changes every show, the animal you are rooting for always survives. :o)",5,True

I don't think it's a justifiable use of my time to elucidate so I'll just say this: The climax hi-jack scene takes place on the onramp of a very jammed up 59th Street Bridge.  Who would hi-jack a truck going into a major traffic jam with only one point of exit -- namely, Manhattan?  I guess that might be nit-picking, but it seems to me that the movie prides itself on a certain boring, realistic nature that it doesn't even manage hold to -- and it's not even interesting when it become fantastic -- a bunch of seriously boring foot races that have no climax.  Oh, and I'm waiting for Oscar Issac to awaken from his coma.  How is that acting?  You could have forkstabbed him and he wouldn't have blinked.  Maybe he was on 'ludes.",1,False

"The only criteria seems to be that within the context of the show - is it funny? There's rarely any consequences to what they do. Each character has few if any redeeming values. But is it funny? Oh yes. The addition of Danny DeVito made a good show great. Introducing the character seemed a bit awkward, but after that it's clear sailing. I particularly like the very special Christmas episode where they each have revelations about their childhoods, but really it's hard to single out any one episode. Its definitely not a &#34;network&#34; show - setup, punch line, laugh track - or a one joke show (I get it - they're nerds and she's hot, or he's fat and so is she - ha ha). That said its not for everybody. A lot of people like one joke shows. But if you like absurd, anything for a laugh comedy - this could for you.",4,True

"I gave 5 stars for this silly, funny man!  Of course, this was prompted by &#34;memories&#34;.  Soupy Sales was a hit back in the early 50s - remember this is still the era of wonderful corny humor.  To, not only hear, but also see humor was just becoming available.  Television sets, as they were called, were not in every home - neighbors invited neighbors - to see this visual treat.<br />My friends and I decided we would visit the show one evening - live TV.  He broadcast from Detroit - still a vibrant,stable city then.The show did not make accommodations for an audience.  Soupy, his crew of cameramen, prop people and these fans were the only ones there.  We were directed to stand any place except on the set.  Soupy was funny every minute we were there - the lines was spontaneous - I doubt rehearsals were a part of readying for his show.<br />I highly recommend Soupy Sales Shows for almost all ages - but you must have an accepting, quirky sense of sight humor..

Why, Sundance???  WHY?????<br /><br />If you’re willing to deal with the emotional sinkhole that is the final episode/season two finale, I highly recommend The Red Road.  I was so excited when watching it because it’s a fantastic show with a stellar cast, and Jason Momoa is a key component.  His character is one of those guys who flirts with the line between a Good Bad Guy and a Bad Good Guy and Momoa sells it.  Hard.  There are a few moments in TRR where he is broken, there are moments when he’s content, and there are moments when he’s flat-out scary.  I loved it.  He deserves awards for his performance.  Particularly the season two finale....",5,True

"I watched this after watching Bess Armstrong in High Road to China.  I wanted to see how she did in something different.  This is an odd movie.  It is a page for page make up of the old '40's and '50's detective movies.  Except Bess Armstrong is the detective.  They dress her in period double breasted (look) suites that men wore except they feminized them.......down to and including the hat and snub nosed 38 in her pocket.  Ms Armstrong tries acting like the old hard nosed male detectives of that genre but it just seems to miss the mark.  For instance, her secretary is young, good looking, maybe not so bright and .........male.  A supposed professional football player calls her up and makes lewd remarks (to her delight .....and this allows her to act like he is her 'plaything' and tries to establish the fact she is a &#34;maniser ........is that the word for women using men.) to her throughout the movie.  Just think of all those old detective movies you saw and how the whiskey drinking,womanizing old detectives acted; now change the sexes of both sides......that's what they did.  Bess Armstrong, I think, could have pulled it off if the script had been better.<br /><br />Now, the movie.  Made for TV grade movie.  That's not a bad thing.  It is a watchable movie and the story is not bad.  You do not feel bad after watching it  Bess Armstrong is easy to look at even when trying to act like a man.  The movie does not seem to take itself seriously and I guess that is it's saving grace.  It allows you to watch it and mentally grade how well they pulled off each 'role reversal' scene as it plays out.  I'm glad I watched it.  I was amused for an hour and a half and I think it cost me $3.00.",3,True

When Road Warrior came out, I absolutely loved what a bigger budget, and better filming could do. And then ThunderDome happened ... not a horrible movie, but not what I was hoping for.  Going into this movie I had fairly low expectations, and I walked away liking it more than I thought I would, but wishing for a whole lot more. When reviewers say it's one long chase scene, they weren't lying. And while action packed, with amazing stunts and film work, I was left wanting to know more about the characters:  how did the cult of the war boys form;  who built this oasis in the desert;  how did the characters we are introduced to, get to where they are.",3,False

Marcia Gay Harden's character is an absolute lunatic, but the so-called &#34;hero&#34; of the movie is even worse. Half the time he has no idea what he's doing and the other half he makes brain-dead decisions (do a search for ending spoilers if you really want to know more). I'm not sure how much different this is from the book, but if it's even close to similar Stephen King can suck it on this one. Honestly, I was having a good day until I mistakenly chose to view this waste of film.",1,False

All that aside, Charlie Theron was incredible in this movie.  Absolutely riveting.  This movie is sad and frightening as it is based on true events.

"A once and always Trekie, I loved the original series and characters, and was really pleased with the casting for the new movies.  Chris Pine's Captain Kirk amplifies the original character's tendency to ignore Starfleet regulations when he feels it is justified, as well as his womanizing and other excesses ... I had to wonder at times how he kept getting away with it ... but somehow the great acting and involving plot prevented it from being a show-stopper. Zachary Quinto's Spock was the biggest surprise to me. There can never be another Leonard Nimoy, but I had no problem accepting Quinto's Spock and was definitely not disappointed. Simon Pegg was fantastic as Scotty, what a choice!  John Cho’s Sulu, Anton Yelchin’s Chekov, Karl Urban’s “Bones” McCoy, and Zoe Saldana as Uhura were also brilliant. Amazingly to me, the development of a relationship between her and Spock added depth to both characters and made me care more about both of them. Some critics have said it tried too hard to tie back to the original series, but for me it was a great, fresh action movie that felt like going home.",5,False

"This is an excellent film - maybe one of the most effective movies I've ever watched.  Eddie Marsan is perfect as John May, a little man whose job it is to find the families of people who have died alone.  Just as he is handed a new case, he is informed that his department is being merged with another, and May is to be laid off.  He is given enough time to finish the latest case.<br /><br />The movie progresses at its own pace - certain to be boring for people who are addicted to the typical fast-paced action film - and is very understated.  One gets the feeling that one is attending a funeral ... which, in a way, one is.  Marsen, again, is perfect for this role.  He is slow (one of the reasons he's being let go from his job), apparently unemotional (Marsen maintains the same neutral appearance almost completely throughout the film) and totally understates his performance.  You genuinely feel sorry for this little man who seems to be going through life without being noticed (at one point, going home after work) he walks between two men who are having an animated conversation in the hallway; he never makes notice of the two men, and they never take notice of him - as if he wasn't even there.<br /><br />The movie is rich with (again, understated) symbolism.  It's there - but you have to look for, and attend to, it.  The direction is excellent; the camera work is perfect, continually giving us a small, uninteresting, picture of a life playing out (almost could be considered claustrophobic, since there is usually no one in the scene but Marsen and the one or two people he's interacting with - and most of the time he is alone).  The soundtrack (what there is of it) is fantastic.<br /><br />On the whole, you are given a plain, slow, empty film that magnificently portrays a plain, slow, empty life.  If you believe that movies can be art, that they can be more than the slap-dashed product of fast action, loud noises, hyperactive people, this movie is for you.  I seriously mean it  when I say that this may be the best movie I have ever seen, in terms of being a film that sets its sight on a goal, finds the perfect way to reach that goal, and diligently applies itself to achieving that goal - and achieves it with magnificent effect.ean it  when I say that this may be the best movie I have ever seen, in terms of being a film that sets its sight on a goal, finds the perfect way to reach that goal, and diligently applies itself to achieving that goal - and achieves it with magnificent effect.",5,True

We have friends who were part of the Osha commune where scenes from this series were shot. The authenticity is amazing for me, giving me a perspective that I didn't get as I grew up in America. Propaganda skewed my understanding as it did citizens in both East and West Germany. I was silly enough to believe US most news broadcasts back then. I'd recommend this series to every American adult who takes seriously their duty to be a well informed voting citizen.<br />Entertainment wise, I enjoy the realism, the set decorations, old gadgets, cars and cloths, but the greenish yellow camera hew and tell-it-like-it-is dialogue might bore someone who is used to seeing the world through a Marvel Comics movie.",5,False

"but incredibly misleading. You can add me to the list of reviewers lamenting that this was pushed as a supernatural thriller, but it simply was not. And there were even allusions to what should have been supernatural activity in any other movie, but here it just lends to inconsistencies as to the nature of the menace, which is incredibly frustrating. I felt like the writer and director purposely misled the audience to try to be clever and throw us a curve, but it just didn't work.<br /><br />However, I do give props for good cinematography, which lent to a few genuinely creepy and disturbing moments. The actors are fine and do the best they can with the material they're given, but holy crap, was the ending cheesy as hell.<br /><br />I wish I could recommend this to those who enjoy more of a slasher type film, but I'm afraid that audience might get bored by the execution, so to speak. So I don't know what audience this was made for and I just can't recommend it.",2,True

"This movie was refreshing after watching a few other movies back to back with it that were purely secular in nature.  After hearing the F bomb repeatedly and watching a bunch of dysfunctional families and sexual situations masquerading as humor, it was nice to watch a movie that had some people in it that were sincerely trying to live better lives.  The Christian message in it is prevalent and I'm sure the critics will find fault with it based on that but even someone who doesn't hold Christian beliefs could watch this and enjoy seeing people genuinely trying to help others.  It was also refreshing to see people who were evaluating their lives and trying to break out of the ruts they were in - from mourning a lost child indefinitely, living with the sadness of not being able to have a child, being homeless and responsible for a child, living with cancer and remorse, and having an identity in a gang.  While its not going to win any academy awards, it was a very satisfying movie to watch and had a good ending weaving. the various characters together in a climatic moment.",4,True

"I really don't get why this is considered one of the top docs of 2014. There is no narration...there is no hints as to what story is attempting to be told. As someone who grew up in rural Kentucky, I feel like I am watching a clumbsily spliced together presentation of people's home videos. There is no story arc. I could easily pull out my own home videos and perhaps request home videos from my friends from back home and submit this crap to Sundance.",1,False
Got bored very quickly,2,True
"I've never been a cheerleader, so looking inside this world has been a guilty pleasure. For some reason season 10 of Making the Team appears less fluid than other seasons. The episodes seem a bit disjointed, like CMT has a new editor in the editing and splicing room and they don't quite get the program. But I enjoy the show so I'll continue watching the season!",4,True
I really like it!,5,True
3 and 5 year old like this have played it several times:),4,True
Incredible life for this person - but in the end the garnered info was so very useful...,5,True
It is just ok.,3,True

I hope they make more!,5,True
Another great performance by Ribisi...,5,True
"Marlhy Murphy and others shine in a brilliant film that fits into the struggle of fitting in, making friends, and joining in musical talent. &#34;A History of Radness&#34; is AMAZING and should be recognized by a bigger audience of people for it's original, standout acting and storyline.",5,True
"I don't care for Trevor Noah.  I think most of his comedy is sophomoric observances of American culture and language.  While it's acceptable coming from Jon Stewart, hearing the same criticisms from someone from South Africa is a wholly different matter.",2,False
Love these mysteries,5,True
Very wacky...Pay attention...six hysterical stories. Clean your eye glasses.  It goes fast.,5,False
More please.  Favorite for our 3 yr old.,5,True
"The Best Short Film I have ever saw.<br />María’s routine at school is altered by the arrival of a very special child. Soon, they become close friends.<br />In my opinion ‘ Strings’ or 'Cuerdas' is a short film written and directed by Pedro Solís García. ‘Strings’ was the 2014 winner of the the Goya ® award for ‘the Best Spanish short film animation’. Pedro Solís García was also awarded with the same prize in 2011 for his first short &#34; The Bruxa &#34;.<br />  The film is full of nuances and describes a tender story of friendship between two special children. ‘Strings’ also speaks of values ​​and illusions and it is able to captivate the viewer from the first frame and the first musical note to the end of the film credits.<br />  The rating of the new short film by Pedro Solis is ‘for all ages and special interest to children’. The Spanish Ministry of Culture has recommended ‘Strings’ for its educational vocation.<br />  &#34;It is a round piece of art that grows up every time that you watch it.&#34;",5,True
Boring. A completely crazy woman.,1,True
"Really enjoyed this, and hope it becomes a full series.",5,True
Nothing groundbreaking but a very well done pilot and an intriguing cast that seems to have enough gas for at least a couple seasons of formulaic drama.,5,True
This is such a cute movie. Actors are all wonderful.,5,True
Didn't finish watching it - Didn't like it at all.,1,False
A story we cannot forget. A cautionary tale about the dire consequences of what happens to humans when man does not respect nature.,4,True
Just wasnt my type of movie..,1,False
Pretty intense,5,True
Very good review of what happened at the Alamo.  I would have liked to see a bit more in depth characters but I looked them all up afterward to learn more about them.,4,False
"After watching this movie, I love Meryl Streep, and my wife knows all about it!<br />I have just recently discovered this extraordinary actor. She deserves her place<br />in Hollywood royalty! This is a great film on several levels.<br />First, that is Meryl Streep singing and playing guitar with a group of L.A.'s<br />best session musicians. She is a believable, and wonderful, musician.<br />Second, her acting is beautiful.<br />Third, the story is a good one.<br />Everything comes together to make this the best film I have seen in a long time.",5,False
I didn't finish watching it because it was annoying to hear/see the British try to take credit for every American invention. Thomas Edison invented the first working lightbulb - AMERICAN. The Wright Brothers - AMERICAN. Or should I say just us lowly colonists.,3,False
"Wow.  Very powerful, very unexpected.  I was so astounded and shocked, because of the nut that Zachary's mother was, that I initially thought some of the events in this film were a practical joke she made up just to make Zachary's grandparents suffer.  I wish I could say more but you may know nothing about this story.  I knew nothing when I rented this.  I'm not sure if that's good or bad.",5,True
Great action from start to end,5,False
My 4 year old loves it.,5,True
"Very entertaining and fun story line, kids and family all enjoyed.  There are no songs sung by the characters unlike practically all other disney movies and even the background music is sparse, all very unlike the Celtic tradition this movie is based on.",4,True
"Sorry, it doesn't deserve one.",1,False
I love it.I never cried watching a movie in years but I did with Winter's Tale....good story line but could of done more with the details,4,True
Tension never lets up.,5,True
"Stopped watching it, so I can't be fair.  But the reasonI stopped watching it was that it seemed to be tending towards a superficial women-as-trophies monie.  The protagonist, though, was an endearingly funny creation: a tour guide who upon arriving at each great French landmark explained that the Italians did it earlier and better.",1,False
"This is one of the most delightful and poignant movies I've ever seen.  I watched it over and over and never got tired of it.  The cast is wonderful, the music delightful and the story, which is a true one, takes us back to innocent times and the spirit of the British people during the WWII.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie that starred Judi Dench that wasn't wonderful.  Bob Hoskins is a perfect foil for the eccentric and gutsy Mrs. Henderson.  Don't miss this one.  You'll come away from it feeling good!",5,True
Watched with 10 year old granddaughter.  We both loved it.  Good movie with a moral to the story,5,True
Fabulous,5,True
Such an adorable movie that you and your little ones will love. Teaches how to be kind to others.,5,False
"There were no good story lines, poor acting, and zero plots are resolved for the ending sequences.  I kept waiting for something to make this movie special, but in the end, it was just drudgery.",1,False
This movie races along trying to get every page in the script giving little time for the actors to act or for the audience to understand.,2,False
"If you need a good laugh, then this is the show for you. Richard Jeni was one of the comedy worlds greatest minds. Direct and controversial at times, he never disappoints with sharp and biting humor that hits the mark every time. A shame it was his last performance.",5,True
Excellent movie!,5,False
Better if you know the source material but I thought the humor fell flat... and i love these actors,2,False
"If this depicts reality in Baltimore, I now know why the city is a mess.",5,True
I was immediately hooked!,5,False
"True to the character from the novels, as nothing comes easy to Bosch.  Excellent acting all around:  Mr. Welliver has one of &#34;those&#34; faces that seems to become transparent, allowing you to read the thoughts beneath.  I plan multiple viewings.",5,True
"I enjoyed the visitant, it was so scary.",4,True
Ok movie,4,False
"Corruption at its darkest and most powerful underpins this venture into a drought stricken Los Angeles of the 1930s. Jack Nicholson is outstanding as the private detective torn between making a living, loyalty and ethics. Faye Dunaway is suitably distressed as a woman condemned by fate and John Huston gives a compelling performance as a despicable man without redeeming virtue. With one question near the conclusion of the movie, the detective shows why the corruption in this case is truly evil.",5,False
"Jonathan Woodley (King Wesley) is a star football player. His family leeches off of him. When he is accused of killing his girlfriend, things are set in motion as the film examines the past of his representatives and the weird relationships in Woodley's family. Blackmail and infidelity.<br /><br />The film was low budget. The sound was second rate. The acting ranged from bad to so-so. The film ran a bunch of stuff about a past murder and a casino and old drug dealers, etc, that it made it confusing when you are trying to cover a murder case. And if someone at an agency was having an affair, would this really be major sports news? Who would really care? I am sure it goes on all the time.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb, implied sex. No nudity.",2,True
"Watch the preview and then save your money.  The preview has all the parts of the story, action and anything interesting in it.  I am going to check any film we might want to watch on Amazon on IMDB first to get real opinions.",1,False
Really good! Reminds me of Kitchen Confidential. Really hoping Amazon lets us watch the later seasons soon.,5,True
"Freudian Eclipse<br /><br />It was male sexual license which brought the Magdalene asylums into existence.  They were non-denominational safe houses for prostitutes and homeless women.  Later, in the mid-nineteenth century the Church, in a  alliance with the State, took them over.  The goals were to continue providing services to “lost women,” cover the costs through the work regime, and provide a social service to the State. In this arrangement, nuns, the lowest members of the Church hierarchy, served as the front line workers, and were no more party to the shaping of the institution, and its expanded client list, than were the rescued women they served.<br /><br />So, there were three forces behind the Catholic Magdalene houses:  the prostitute users and rapists who created the inmates, the State which hid both sexual license and its victims, and the Church which gained communal and moral sway.<br /><br />“The Magdalene Sisters” snuffs this broader context, choosing to see the oppression and suffering through the reductive lens of personal sexual repression.  The nuns are not viewed in any sense as co-victims or sisters to their charges but as authoritarian, sadistic old maids.  Though they work from dawn until dusk with house, factory, and prayer work, their lives are viewed as hypertrophied.  Even in their only human moment during the communal viewing of “The Bells of St. Mary,” they quickly revert to their stepmother harshness.  That sexual repression owns their actions, determines their person is specifically underscored in the villainous stripping game they force on the inmates, as if they were male screws in a women’s prison.<br /><br />If one had to choose the dominant symbols of sexual repression in western culture today, nuns, priests, women, and Catholic Ireland would no doubt first come to mind.  “The Magdalene Sisters” pushes all these buttons--and sparks the film with some sexual scenes and sexual fun and games to boot.<br /><br />The sex abusive priest exists in the same mold as the young rapist at the Catholic-ridden music event. Their acts are not so much the problem as is their sexual repression born of a puritanical Irish Catholicism. What the priest suffers for his act is a prank which divests him of layers of hypocritical clothing.  The laughable strip tease is no doubt more popular and desirable to a modern audience than some “politically correct” form of public justice. But the exculpation of criminal acts is still in place, as it is in the case of that same violent rapist lad--to whom nothing at all happens.<br /><br />Anyway, when the girls enter the gate, we’re supposed to believe that their persecution begins right then.  The world they have left behind (run by and for men) goes scot free, but the world they enter, a women’s world, is a prison.  The Sisters of Mercy are the torturers.  And Mother Superior is the unbending warden, while nuns young and old, having suppressed all kindness,  understanding and intelligence, are the merciless screws. Their incarceration techniques are are so effective that the State has washed its hands of its supervisory role.<br /><br />The social context is replaced by the private narrative. The political is psychologized. Women are pitted against women.  Freud’s myth of sexual repression, so powerfully adhered to in  Hollywoodland, displace sexual license, and the State’s/Church’s central role in protecting it.<br /><br />In sum, Christ, a man, can understand Mary Magdalene; the Sisters of Mercy,  working in the Magdalene homes, and all women, cannot.  Because they are the scapegoat.",3,True

"Bad acting, bad story, bad camerawork, bad everything. I watched a third of it but wasn't willing to waste any more time hoping it would pay off. The movie actually made me kind of sick to my stomach. Just watch any version of &#34;Ten Little Indians&#34; or &#34;And Then There Were None&#34; that you can find instead of this outlandish parody. You'll get much more out of those.",1,False
"Engaging crime/mafia based drama remincent of &#34;Sopranos&#34;, but slightly more sex and violence.  Wish there was another season.",5,True
"I really wanted to like this movie. It has a good story line, a lot of potential BUT there is absolutely NOOOOO Chemistry between the the lesbian couple. The casting is awful. They don't seem connected, they barely seem like close friends let alone a couple in love. There is no true warmth between them and that ruined the entire movie for me and my wife.",2,True

HAD to buy the collection!!,5,True
"In a word, horrid<br /><br />Emotionally constipated DCI Vera casts a cloud over the entire program, although there's not much to uplift the audience anyway, with a cast of characters who all lack redeeming or virtuous  qualities",1,False

"Way too scary for my six year old. Some kids might not be bothered by it, but my six year old was pleading that we turn it off. I assumed it wouldn't be too scary because of the G rating but then upon researching it further on common sense media's website I see that numerous people have found it to be too scary. Just be aware, nothing like watching a movie before bed time that's going to cause the kids to have night mares all night...",1,False
