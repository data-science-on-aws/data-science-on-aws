About 15 minutes (make that 10 minutes) into the first episode, I stopped watching and have since deleted the episodes. I will not be purchasing the DVD's. The casting of Elizabeth was just wrong. Where was our &#34;loveliest, dearest Elizabeth&#34; with fine eyes, a lively wit and light step. I admit that this is not an intelligent critique of the series, of course, as I did not watch it. If you can get past the casting of Elizabeth, as I could not, you may enjoy these DVD's. I will contine to watch my Jennifer Ehle, Keira Knightly and Elizabeth Garve versions of Pride & Prejudice.",2015-08-31,0.6666666666666666,False,0

First, I head to every sporting goods store and stock up on firearms and ammunition.  I buy bows and arrows.  Hunting knives.  Camp stoves.  Batteries of every shape and size -- including every car battery I can afford.  I then find the nearest Walmart and start stocking up on canned and dried goods, not to mention all the other day to day stuff one would like to have on hand.  There is more I would do.....but what do these people do?  Explore the wall....wonder about split cows and crashed planes, and wander in circles.<br /><br />This show is a train wreck of bad writing.  But I just keep watching, wondering what weird direction some character will take in the next episode.  First, Jr. is a sociopath who chains is girlfriend up in a bomb shelter to &#34;save&#34; her.  Now he's a hero.  First, Big Jim is a good guy trying to keep things together, then he's a councilman supporting a drug dealer, then he's just an idiot.  Now he's a sociopath. Big Jim actually expresses more multiple personalities than most criminals trying to use a multiple personality defense.  Every character in this show is all over the place.  We never know what personality trait a character might develop next.<br /><br />Strangely enough, the acting is great, and the underlying story line seems solid (as I'd expect with Stephen King), it's just that each episode seems to have forgotten what the last set forth.  I'm astounded crap like this gets three or four seasons when extremely well written shows barely survive a year.  Must be the King and Spielberg names.....<br /><br />Can't blame Stephen King for making money....but if I were him, I'd be embarrassed to have my name attached to this mess.",2015-08-31,0.75,False,0

I love Kristen Wiig and her choices of movies, and I really think that Joaqu&iacute;n Phoenix is a good actor, but I can't say the same about these two. Although, Adam Pally is better at it than Sarah Burns is in this, but I have to admit, I have not seen either of them in any other movie (that I am aware of) so I can't really say they are bad actors 100% of the time, only in this. I felt for both of these people they were portraying immediately, I actually cared for them, I had high hopes. About midway through, I stopped caring for her completely, mainly I guess (maybe) it could be that she may actually had been acting so well that her character made me dislike her, but, whatever, I don't think that the makers of this movie wanted that to happen. (The script itself is probably at fault here , so that also means all of those in charge were at fault) In any movie you need to care about the characters, if you go too far and those in charge make you actually stop caring, you are going to be on a very slippery slope, and these slid all of the way down the hill as far as I was concerned. Yes, I do know that Sarah's character was supposed to be this way, but too much is just too much. The character, &#34;Beth&#34; would've been a better choice for Sarah's part, I feel, I liked her more, and she had some acting skills and her and Adam had good chemistry together.<br />The premise for this movie was good enough, I liked the idea, and had it been handled by writers and directors, plus, the actors, just a little better, I would be writing a different review. (I am not a very good reviewer, I only do this if I am 'trying to' help someone either see a good movie, or, stay away from one that may be considered a bad one)<br />Also really, I am not a prude at all, but this had quite a bit of raunchy humor in it that was unnecessary, there is no need to say all of the stuff they said, especially that many times, and I promise, I say those words myself, but for me, in a romantic comedy they should not be raunchy. (That's just how I feel, I am old-fashioned that way) To me, a successful romantic comedy is one like, Sleepless in Seattle, (I know, I know) they did it right, so well in fact, they had immediate copycat movies by others that followed their lead, even the same directors and producers tried to keep that formula going with, You Got Mail!, all to no avail. Still though, SiS did it the way it should be, no really bad words, and it was romantic, but to shove literal bathroom humor into a movie that wants to make history (like SiS did) or entertain us, or make one want to watch it over and over again. Keep it clean, use the proven track record of movies in the past that succeeded without having to resort to lowering its standards to appeal to today's internet types. Above all, NEVER, EVER have Rosie O. in any of your movies... :) (I had to say it)<br />Anyway, Slow Learners wasn't all bad, it had some definite funny parts, the two dorky nerds in the book club were the best, they had some genuine comedic lines that made me laugh out loud several times. There were also a few others in this that I liked and did a pretty good job with their parts.<br />Hopefully the two main stars in this movie will get better parts, or learn to act, or something, I don't hate their acting, only in this movie, and I am sure that there will be those that would like this and not see it the way I did, but that's is how I saw it... Maybe I'll see them in another movie and I'll eat my words, I really hope so.<br /><br />I would give this 2-1/2 stars though if I could, but I can't using  Amazon's rating system.ere is no need to say all of the stuff they said, especially that many times, and I promise, I say those words myself, but for me, in a romantic comedy they should not be raunchy.

This was quite evident in by him being illiterate even after being over 100 years old.

Worse yet, the shadows are alive and are trying kill everyone. On paper, Vanishing on 7th Street sounds like a sure fire win for a horror movie. It plays on the natural fear of the dark many people have, has plenty of mystery that keeps you engaged, and it has a fairly solid cast with the likes of Christensen (who shouldn't be judged by the poor script he had in the Star Wars prequels), Thandie Newton, and John Leguizamo.<br /><br />Sadly, while the film does have some decent scares and manages to maintain some level of tension. It never fully achieves the potential it sets itself up for. Between hokey CGI shadow effects, hackneyed usage of true historical mysteries with easy explanations that blow the film's supposed explanation out of the water, and truly stupid character decisions the film feels more like a bad Doctor Who episode (and given that show actually had an episode about killer shadows that was AMAZING makes this film look all the more worse). Add onto that, a truly stupid ending with obvious biblical undertones and a shot that rips off the iconic image of The Walking Dead's Rick Grimes riding his horse down an abandoned highway and you have the mediocre strawberry on a truly disappointing cake.<br /><br />Not to mention, it's way too easy to make &#34;Dark side of the force&#34; jokes throughout the entire film's run time.

Jeong Bae (Lee Sun-kyun) is a struggling artist in the manga (called &#34;manhwa&#34; in Korea) world of sex and violence comic books. He learns of a contest with a first prize of $100,000 USD. The only problem is that Jeong Bae needs a script writer to complement his artistic skills. He interviews various candidates, all of whom do not exactly fit into his scheme of a hero who can combine manga type sex and violence into a winning formula.  Enter Han Da-rim (Choi Kang-hee) whose own sleazy background is acceptably graphic. The romance of the film begins with the inevitable bickering between her vision of a hero and his. She sees Jeong Bae as one who is locked into a losing image of commercial manga art whereas he sees her as too graphic (if one can be so in manga) to work with. Much of PETTY ROMANCE is replete with manga style animation with a stylized female assassin fetchingly clad as she slices and dices her way through legions of hapless victims.  There is little doubt however that this bickering will by the closing credits lead to a satisfying climax of personal and professional success. There is nothing petty about PETTY ROMANCE. The leads bounce off each other in ways that seem somehow real despite the unreality of their linking professions.  One can sense that PETTY ROMANCE is a fine example of a Hollywood style romance of the 1930s that is just as entertaining today in Korea as Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn were in their heyday.",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

How they got her to agree to be interviewed, I don't know, but it says something about the producers that they were able to accomplish this.<br /><br />We've all seen Mr. Strand's photos, so I think the whole point in watching a movie about him is to learn more about him and his life.<br />I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought the (quite brief, actually) segment about his career in film making was slow, as my impression was quite the opposite, and since this is a documentary film and Mr. Strand spent many years as a movie cameraman it's completely logical that this would also be a part of the film, not just his still photography. I thought this segment was very interesting, especially to see his film making style, which reminded me of Sergei Eisenstein's, and which we probably won't see anywhere else, and to learn that he was taking on very serious subjects such as racial intolerance, the KKK, and McCarthyism. Also that his decision to move to Europe was largely because of these issues.<br /><br />Seeing Mr. Strand wielding his monstrously huge Graflex SLR (5x7?) was also a highlight.<br /><br />The musical soundtrack was nothing special, kind of typical of a low budget documentary, but I wasn't watching the movie to listen to the music. The &#34;Ken Burns&#34; style of showing the photos was the weakest and most distracting part of the film for me. I felt that the film makers should have displayed the photos in full view first, and then panned around if they felt the need to push that button on iMovie. If the rest of the film had not been so informative I would have knocked a star off for this, but there was so much else about it that was really good that I kept it at five.<br /><br />I was not surprised at the end to learn from the credits that this film was funded by the Canadian National Film Board. I have watched numerous documentaries funded by this agency, and they have all been of high quality. One can also go to their website and watch a lot of movies for free. Most of them were made by the CBC.",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

The result is a Heller-esque tale replete with absurdities and inanities of military servitude.  It took a woman to tell this story.  Unlike other military movies, this one is almost entirely female - other than two smaller parts that come to mind, girls rule here.<br /><br />Lavie's script stitches together three loosely connected tales: &#34;01: The Replacement&#34;; &#34;02: The Virgin&#34; and &#34;03: The Commander&#34;. The constant in the three stories is the presence of Dana Ivgy as Zohar. Ms. Ivgy is a personal favorite dating back to [[ASIN:B000255L98 Broken Wings]]. She's a great actress and an arresting on screen presence even when dressing down or meant to be bristly and difficult like she is here.  Ivgy shines brightest in Lavie's 2nd story as the title character.<br /><br />The movie' surprise, though, is Nelly Tagar as Daffi.  She plays a big part in the first story, ostensibly training her replacement as she angles for reassignment in Tel Aviv. Tagar is a naturally gifted physical comedienne with fun, expressive eyes.  Her ability to cry on contact plays a big part in the story and to watch her to do it with aplomb -- and have you chuckle at the results -- is a real treat.  I was saddened to see her not appear n the second tale, but excited to see her return in the third and finale story, whose title -- The Commander -- is a neat little head fake from Lavie.<br /><br />The third star turn in the film is that of Shani Klein as Rama, a commander and boss to Zohar and Daffi.  I really liked Ms. Klein in this role.  Her Rama is a thin sheen of bluster with a sensitive core underneath. Zohar doesn't see it, but the audience can.",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

Not only the part how this movie describes human condition but also the historical part of the movie. I highly recommend this stylistically well made movie because it is just so amazing when I see the horse jumping around the field and bring hopes to the people in the Great War.<br />The background of the movie happened during the World War I. The horse, named Joey, did not give up on his life during the Great War. Joey brought hopes to the devastated soldiers on both Allies and Germans. During World War I, millions of people died because the war was fought in a different way, as known as trench war. Generals make soldiers dig trenches to make defiance and it makes the offence become very hard, and even more, the troops are already using machine guns from the beginning of the war and millions of people will die under the machine guns. When Joey ran in to the field, there are wires and bodies everywhere. Suddenly, Joey was trapped in the wires and both Germans and British soldiers can’t believe what they are seeing – a living animal at the middle of the war zone. The appeared of Joey makes both German and British send a soldiers to help rescue him and that makes troops on both sides disengage for a while. After Joey was rescued, he was send back to the doctor for surgery and at the same place is where he met his original owner, Albert. After the war, Joey and Albert went back to home together and the movie end with a happy ending.<br />After watching the whole movie, I can feel the powerful vitality spreading from Joey, miracles happened on this creature.

I've been a huge fan of this show since its first few episodes, and though it was hanging on by a thread in the ratings after Seasons 1 and 2, I was hopeful that its critical acclaim and rabid fanbase would be enough to keep it around until everybody else caught on. Unfortunately, that won't be the case and we'll never get to find out how amazing things could have been had the show been allowed to adapt The Silence of the Lambs. This season was divided into two halves, the first of which finished off the adaptation of the book Hannibal, and the second that focused solely on the novel Red Dragon. Accordingly, the first half of the season was pure gothic horror, bizarre, surreal, and disturbing. While several character outcomes were distorted or rearranged, it was more faithful to events in the book than the first two seasons while expertly substituting both Will Graham and Alana Bloom for Clarice Starling's parts. Then, the show became truly greater than it's ever been with the addition of Richard Armitage (The Hobbit's Thorin Oakenshield) as Francis Dolarhyde. The entire Red Dragon arc has been by far the closest the show has followed its source material, but the first two seasons have served to breathe new life into a story that has already been adapted to film twice before. The backstory and relationships between all of the principle characters give this story so much more vitality than it's ever had, it crushes me even more that they won't be able to do Silence of the Lambs. Sadly, the show never had the rights to that novel, but had hopes that they'd be attainable somewhere along the line. Since it never happened, they used Graham and Bloom in place of Starling in the first half of the season, then Bloom again in the final episode. While only a brief nod to &#34;Lambs,&#34; Bloom comes to Hannibal with an offer from the FBI, one that facilitates his escape from prison. Although the reason for the offer and its outcome are far different from &#34;Lambs,&#34; it was an obvious allusion to Thomas Harris's most famous story. Instead, knowing that the show would not be resurrected by another platform, the last episode offers finality to both main characters, and closes the door on any future attempt to revive the series. Make no mistake, it was a beautifully tragic way to finish off the connection between Will and Hannibal, but it's bitterly disappointing to see it all come to an end. Thanks are in order to Bryan Fuller, the writers, and the enthralling actors that made this show such a masterpiece. The only consolation is knowing that Will and Hannibal will not only be together forever, but will both provide one last meal before they depart. And in that regard, they will always have a leg up on poor, shattered Bedelia.<br /><br />*Edit- After the finale, Bryan Fuller stated in an interview that Martha Stewart of all people is trying to get financing to back a Hannibal feature film, likely as a TV mini-series. He seems very enthusiastic to finish off his vision of Hannibal and Will, suggesting that they survive their fall, ala Sherlock Holmes. While I'm hopeful, I just don't see it happening, but he mentioned Bedelia hiding her fork at the end of the finale, a possible clue that Hannibal is still alive. Only time will tell.one that facilitates his escape from prison.

Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34;  Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film.

Johnny Hazzard plays one brother who is outspoken, a major flirt, and a party type guy who does what he wants when he wants and to whomever. He is easy on the eyes and makes no bones about his sexuality. Mark Strano plays the other brother he is a homebody who has stayed in the family home and continued to run the family business. He is not the social butterfly, more protected and straight acting.  The two brothers find themselves back together as the fancy free brother is broke and homeless and needs somewhere to land and the more put together brother needs to open up himself more and be true to who he is.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully made movie about family and friendship, love and longing and the ghosts from the past. An an actor Johnny Hazzard has improved so much from his past roles in cheesy porn like soap operas such as The Lair, and knew to me at least Mark Strano could not have played a better character that many people can identify with.<br />Highly recommend this movie.",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

They were non-denominational safe houses for prostitutes and homeless women.  Later, in the mid-nineteenth century the Church, in a  alliance with the State, took them over.  The goals were to continue providing services to “lost women,” cover the costs through the work regime, and provide a social service to the State. In this arrangement, nuns, the lowest members of the Church hierarchy, served as the front line workers, and were no more party to the shaping of the institution, and its expanded client list, than were the rescued women they served.<br /><br />So, there were three forces behind the Catholic Magdalene houses:  the prostitute users and rapists who created the inmates, the State which hid both sexual license and its victims, and the Church which gained communal and moral sway.<br /><br />“The Magdalene Sisters” snuffs this broader context, choosing to see the oppression and suffering through the reductive lens of personal sexual repression.  The nuns are not viewed in any sense as co-victims or sisters to their charges but as authoritarian, sadistic old maids.  Though they work from dawn until dusk with house, factory, and prayer work, their lives are viewed as hypertrophied.  Even in their only human moment during the communal viewing of “The Bells of St. Mary,” they quickly revert to their stepmother harshness.  That sexual repression owns their actions, determines their person is specifically underscored in the villainous stripping game they force on the inmates, as if they were male screws in a women’s prison.<br /><br />If one had to choose the dominant symbols of sexual repression in western culture today, nuns, priests, women, and Catholic Ireland would no doubt first come to mind.  “The Magdalene Sisters” pushes all these buttons--and sparks the film with some sexual scenes and sexual fun and games to boot.<br /><br />The sex abusive priest exists in the same mold as the young rapist at the Catholic-ridden music event. Their acts are not so much the problem as is their sexual repression born of a puritanical Irish Catholicism. What the priest suffers for his act is a prank which divests him of layers of hypocritical clothing.  The laughable strip tease is no doubt more popular and desirable to a modern audience than some “politically correct” form of public justice. But the exculpation of criminal acts is still in place, as it is in the case of that same violent rapist lad--to whom nothing at all happens.<br /><br />Anyway, when the girls enter the gate, we’re supposed to believe that their persecution begins right then.  The world they have left behind (run by and for men) goes scot free, but the world they enter, a women’s world, is a prison.  The Sisters of Mercy are the torturers.  And Mother Superior is the unbending warden, while nuns young and old, having suppressed all kindness,  understanding and intelligence, are the merciless screws. Their incarceration techniques are are so effective that the State has washed its hands of its supervisory role.<br /><br />The social context is replaced by the private narrative. The political is psychologized. Women are pitted against women.  Freud’s myth of sexual repression, so powerfully adhered to in  Hollywoodland, displace sexual license, and the State’s/Church’s central role in protecting it.<br /><br />In sum, Christ, a man, can understand Mary Magdalene; the Sisters of Mercy,  working in the Magdalene homes, and all women, cannot.  Because they are the scapegoat.",2015-08-30,1.0,True,0

Kaddish is recited at the graveside, not Shema. The Native American ritual was likewise built on stereotype and very little knowledge of authentic tradition. &#34;Wolf,&#34; whom &#34;Tiger&#34; meets just too conveniently pops up at very contrived moments, and his father being in the hospital is just too precious and absurd. The characters are one-dimensional and cardboard.

Instead of making the monsters terrifying or sexy to braindead underage girls, they give them a sense of humanity and a desire to simply live life like us normal, pre-dead average joes.<br /><br />With talents like Jemaine Clement of Flight of The Conchords in the lead roles, this film is filled with hilarious scenes of blood-sucking, shapeshifting, and in some cases monstrous vampires dealing the the troubles of modern day life. Ever wonder if vampires hate getting blood on the carpet during every meal? Well it's addressed here in hilarious fashion. How does someone who has recently been turned into a vampire essentially &#34;come out&#34; to his best friend while addressing the elephant in the room, that many of his new friends want to eat said best friend? You have the best friend introduce the new vampire friends to the wonders of modern technology! Ever wonder what happens when two vampires have an argument? They turn into bats and fight one another.<br /><br />Simply said, What We Do In The Shadows is a hilarious film brimming with tons of dark humor lightened by the fact that these creatures of the night just want to have a good time and get the rent paid on time.",2015-08-31,0.8620689655172413,True,1

The romantic storyline between Stone and Cooper. She is obnoxious and Uncharming. (She is a female Sheldon Cooper.) He seems more interested in his Ex.<br /><br />4. McAdams and Cooper resolving the past and accepting the present. Both seem very happy in their present circumstances, so it made no sense why after 13 years they would meet up.

The characters are hilarious, and strangely Guest managed to include many of his favorite actors, including Michael McKean, Fred Willard, and, of course, Christopher Guest himself.<br /><br />Chris O'Dowd (from The IT Crowd) plays an Irishman from an English family who starts searching for his family roots after his late aunt leaves him a box of junk that turns out to be full of clues about his family's history. Eventually his quest leads him to California where he discovers a bunch of distant and strange relatives. The series ends unexpectedly with the main character torn between returning home and staying in California. It definitely feels like this show was meant to get a second season, but alas that didn't happen.<br /><br />One thing I love about the series is that the female characters are often funnier than the men. The main character's sister is deeply attached to a monkey puppet with a filthy mouth, and the main character's stepmother... let me just say there's a scene involving her where she isn't seen and you can't even hear her, but she made me laugh so long and hard.<br /><br />The whole thing is shot faux documentary style, which shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Christopher Guest's work. In many ways, it reminds me of the original UK version of The Office, but without a drop of meanness. Chris O'Dowd's character has an open heart, and he's more than willing to embrace anything and everything he discovers about his family, no matter how insane it may be.<br /><br />I loved this show. The only problem I had with it (except for one unnecessary R-rated scene) is that it ended way too soon. It would be great if someone picked it up for a second season.

What attracted me to this show was the breakdown and rebuilding of a society during a disaster, and the possible supernatural tie-in. Season 2, I forgave, because most sophomore seasons are exposition-laden, wobbly and never really as good as the first. Season 3... Well, this season was very painful to watch. The dialogue was predictable and uninspired (Dean Norris, you have been robbed!), and the plot is super messy. It's as if the point of this season was to render all of season 2 moot, by essentially getting rid of characters and story lines that were prominent in it (what was the point of the Melanie character at all? Or Junior's Mom and that damn red door?) and using a warped-time line to force the plot into some other crazy direction.<br /><br />It seems the &#34;in thing&#34; to kill off main characters in shows these days, which is something I applaud: in my belief, the story should come first, not the actors' contracts or network's pocketbooks. But there are 3 deaths in the first two episodes that just didn't even need to happen. The story didn't move forward, or anywhere, because of those deaths. And, as a woman, I am against woman-shaming, but Marg Helgnberger's lips need some serious fixing. That's all I can think about in her scenes, and she has so very many scenes! SPOILER ALERT: I am only sticking around because I heard the dome comes down this season. With one episode left, it better!  I don't think I'll be back to watch this next year. Stephen King, you've disappointed me here, but I will buy the book. It has to be a million times better than the show!<br /><br />9/8/15 Update: yay!

In a matter of ten years, he’s managed to direct eighteen feature films (including his latest “Digging For Fire”). Most of these have been made completely outside of the studio-system, being financed through credit cards and actors donating their time. They’re purely improvisational, with Swanberg’s only tool being an outline that he’s authored. The actors, in turn, must completely inhabit their characters to the point of knowing what they might say or even do. “Digging For Fire”, which is undoubtedly his most star-studded film to date, takes this to a whole new level. Veterans such as Sam Elliott and Judith Light are sharing the screen with younger actors like Jake Johnson and Rosemarie DeWitt.<br /><br />The latter couple playing a husband and wife who, after finding a rusted gun and apparent human bone in the backyard of a house they’re staying in, are lead on separate adventures over the course of one weekend. The husband - obviously more curious about what else he might find - invites a group of his long-time friends to drink a few beers and dig up the truth. Meanwhile, his wife takes their son to visit her parents and get away from some of the marital stresses she’s facing.<br /><br />It’s this wonderfully odd comedy/mystery that’s entirely propelled by the connection between the actors and the director. There’s an evident trust between the two, and the movie is infinitely better for that. Not to mention the fact that it’s just a lot of fun to watch. The varied cast works together beautifully (some of the others include Orlando Bloom, Anna Kendrick, and Sam Rockwell) and the story unfolds in a charming and clever fashion. Definitely give Swanberg’s latest film a look. He has a long and storied career ahead of him.",2015-08-31,0.8636363636363636,True,1

Then they would sell the movie to audiences based on the star appeal rather than the content of the film. Most of this genre stunk something awful. (I'm looking at you, New Year's Eve) But Love Actually really delivers. It's an anomaly.<br /><br />It is still a bunch of actors crammed into small roles with a loosely connected story line.<br /><br />But the theme of each mini story is the same, that love is strong and takes on many different forms. You can love your wife, love your best friend, love your family, love a girlfriend, love someone you cant' have, love someone you can have, love your kids, love your country, etc etc etc. Some love is easy and fun (The Prime Minister and his girlfriend) some love is hard (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's marriage) and some love is down right painful (Laura Linney caring for a mentally ill brother).<br /><br />Each story comes back to that theme in the end, that no matter what else is going on in life and no matter how bad the world seems, there is love all around us. It's everywhere, and it's not hard to find. All you have to do is open your eyes to look for it.<br /><br />However, count me on the side of people who think that Andrew Lincoln's character was WAY out of line to go to Keira Nightly's house shortly after she's married to Lincoln's best friend to profess his undying love for her. That's not sweet. That's not cool, man. That's some low down home wrecking stuff there. People are split 50/50 on this scene. Some people think it's really sweet. But the truth is that he's unburdening his soul at the risk of damaging his best friend's marriage. That's not good. That's selfish.",2015-08-31,0.6666666666666666,False,1

An excellent B movie.,"FINAL DESTINATION is a color movie taking place in the present era.  The plot concerns a group of high school students taking an overseas field trip to France.  The high school students are accompanied by two adult teachers.  During the first half hour, the students gather in an airplane terminal and board the plane.  Then, one of the students takes a nap and has a dream where a latch handle falls of from the flip-down table at his seat, where the plane then starts shaking, where oxygen masks all are released into the passenger compartment, where a fire starts inside the cabin, where a chunk of the wall blows out and a passenger is sucked out of her seat into the atmosphere, and where the plane crashes.  Then, the student wakes up from his awful dream, and tugs on the latch handle, and it falls off just like in his dream.  Then, the student realizes that this is a harbinger of the airplane crash.  At this point, the plane has not yet taken off.  The student (Devon Sawa) raises and alarm and rushes out of the airplane, and a handful of the other students join him and leave the airplane.  The group of students watch the airplane take off from the runway, and they are shocked when they see the airplane blow up in mid-air.  The remaining hour of the movie concerns the notion that the fate of each of the surviving students is somehow predetermined, and that each of the surviving students will soon die.  Two agents from the FBI spend this remaining  hour tailing the student.  The actors playing the FBI agents are very good, and this aspect of the plot adds a further dimension of suspense to the plot.<br /><br />Much of the movie concerns the role of fate in killing off the surviving students and the surviving teacher.  Because of the somewhat repetitive aspects of this portion of the plot, it might be reasonable to characterize FINAL DESTINATION as a &#34;B movie.&#34;  But it is a good movie, and it provides food for thought regarding the concept of pre-destination.  Theending of this movie is not really a distinct one.  The plot just sort of withers away suddenly.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS.  The special effects are excellent.  The tilting and shaking of the airplane, as depicted in the student's dream, is excellent.  The fire and explosion where a chunk of the wall is blown out, is very realistic looking.  After the airplane sequence, much of the rest of the movie shows electric sparks, tumbling kitchen knives the plunge into a schoolteacher's chest, and fires caused by spilled alcoholic beverages.  These are all realistic.<br /><br />TWENTY TWO.  The closest story that I know to FINAL DESTINATION is a Twilight Zone episode called, Twenty Two.  Twenty Two stars Barbara Nichols, who is a nightclub dancer experiencing mental exhaustion.  She is in a hospital receiving care for her exhaustion, when one of the hospital employees (Arlene Martel) who works in the hospital's morgue says to Barbara Nichols, &#34;Room for one more, honey.&#34;  Arlene Martel (who is more like a spirit than a real person) also provides a warning to Barbara Nichols, right before boarding an airplane.  Barbara Nichols decides to return to the terminal, and from the terminal she sees the airplane blowing up.  Hence, in my opinion, watching Twenty Two will enhance your enjoyment and appreciation of FINAL DESTINATION.  Another Twilight Zone episode should also be mentioned.  This is PRIVATE CHANNEL from the color Twilight Zone episodes, from 1986-1987.  PRIVATE CHANNEL is just as excellent as TWENTY TWO, but since it is of more recent cinematographic vintage, it is the case the the acting in PRIVATE CHANNEL has much more pizzazz.  Scott Coffey plays the starring role, as man about 18 to 22 years old, who acquires a premonition that his airplane will crash.  Scott Coffey ends up saving all the passengers of a jet plane (including himself) from a bomb.  To repeat, both of these Twilight Zone episodes have a plot similar to that in FINAL DESTINATION, and will likely enhance your enjoyment of FINAL DESTINATION.",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

It ended up being added to the list of interesting looking movies I never got around to seeing.  Big mistake.  Ex Machina turned out to be one of the best movies I have seen all year.  The premise is fascinating yet simple - An employee of a large computer company wins a week long stay at the companies founders retreat.  The company founder is a legendary genius who has dropped off the grid to work on some secret project.  The project turns out to be artificial intelligence.  His creation is the lovely looking machine like creation seen in the advertisements, so I'm not giving anything away.  The premise then is turned on it's ear as we are taken into the relationships which are formed between the creator, the employee, and the creation.  It is a testament to the acting and filmmaking that your beliefs and alliances get all tangled up and twisted.  Some people may be put off by a concern the movie will be too technical or highbrow.  While it does have its moments, there was never a point where it went too far and lost the viewer.  It is not at all like &#34;2001 A Space Odyssey&#34;.  That movie has always been a divisive wrestling match between people.  This movie instead manages to be thoughtful and thought provoking without going over the top.  The ending comes with a surprise twist, and it is perfect.  It is not at all contrived to make things fit into a neat little box.  The cinematography is wonderful - claustrophobic, foreboding, yet beautiful.  The juxtaposition between nature and technology are all around, and it all adds to the mood of the film.  Extremely well done and inspired.  Although it probably will be forgotten around Oscar time, the set design is fantastic.  There is swearing, drinking, and nudity, none of which is gratuitous.  Highly recommended.",2015-08-31,0.3333333333333333,False,1

It wasn't that good!&#34; and I, not having seen Song of the Sea (or Boxtrolls, or Kaguya), was thinking that they were a bunch of sore losers and that Big Hero 6, even with its flaws, was a great movie with fun characters, quick plot, and good lessons, and deserved the win.<br /><br />After I watched Song of the Sea, I found myself in the camp of teeth gnashers. It's not that Big Hero 6 isn't a good movie, Song of the Sea is simply a BETTER one.<br /><br />The same storybook style that was so intriguing in the Secret of the Kells has evolved into something transcendent in Song of the Sea. The characters are very relatable even if you are not familiar with the Irish backdrop and the inheritance of Irish folklore that runs through this film's veins (heaven knows I was a bit lost with all that talk of Tir Na Nog and giants and fairies). The main character is a little boy who loses his mother on the night his sister is born. The loss breaks his father and induces the paternal grandmother to try and get the kids to stay with her, in the city, instead of on their little lighthouse island. We see how much the little boy resents his sister, and though it's clear that it's unjustified--she's a sweet, curious, and quiet little girl--we still can't help but sympathize with him a bit. This starting point makes his subsequent physical journey as he tries to get back to his lighthouse home from his grandma's house in the city, and the emotional growth as he finally confronts the wounds in his heart and tries to find closure to a tragedy, all the more substantial. You see real character development, and it happens in such a natural, organic way (even with all the fairies and owls about).<br/><br />Put it this way--the movie's ending is heartbreaking, whether you read too deeply into the symbolism of it or not. But it's also strangely uplifting, as though the whole movie is meant to be heartbreaking, until the very end, when sadness becomes acceptance, and acceptance into joy at a new day.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film to both children and adults. I'm not sure who would cry more: mom and dad, or the kids. My husband and I blubbered quite a bit at some points, but it was cathartic in its own way, so I'll consider it a bonus. I fully intend to add this movie to my hardcopy collection; it really is that good. Better than an inflatable robot hero.",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

The standard version was fuzzy and appeared to be downgraded. It appears that the person who cast the actors did not read the books, or perhaps there just was not anyone who fit the part of Jamie?  I am disappointed that the author agreed on the actor who plays Jamie (And I know from other reviews that I am not alone.). The actors who play Claire and Jamie are good, but the chemistry that is supposed to be between them is missing. Maybe some of the fiery looks that should be exchanged between them were edited out?  Jaime is supposed to be a tall red haired warrior and I apparently cannot get over the fact that the actor who plays him is not.

She has an slightly older boyfriend, not in high school, who is in a band that is on the verge of breaking out into the big time. Experiencing the comfort of home and fear of an uncharted future when BLAM!  (SPOILER ALERT)  On a snow day there's a car accident that leaves her unconscious/severely  injured and Mom & Dad dead.  Her little brother seems to have gotten the least of it, but nope, he dies too.  While all this is going on she is having an out of body experiences and basically has to decide if she's going to go towards the light like her family.  Who doesn't seem to have been offered that choice.  But then again, we don't see any other out of body people even at the hospital so maybe the audience is only privy to Mia's plight.  Or the other choice that she is reminded of by the living is to fight for life and stay.  That's all I'm going to say about the plot.<br /><br />I generally like this type of movie.

Do I like it? I bought it twice, so yeah. After I walked by a table with a couple of guys selling their film, I was immediately captivated by the cinematography that was being shown on the 10 inch screen. This looked too well done for a project that didn't have a big studio behind it. Needless to say,  it was better than I thought.<br /><br />Dead Weight is a survivor movie more than a zombie film. With dark humor and a little romance, it surprised me with the connection I made with the characters which is in large part due to the writing and editing of the film. Unlike most post apocalyptic films, it is the journey of a group not only trying to survive starvation, the elements and other survivors but with a specific destination that keeps them going.  Specifically, Charlie who is going to make this destination no matter what in hopes of reuniting with his girlfriend Samantha.  With no confirmation that his girlfriend Samantha is even there, Charlie becomes obsessed and nothing will stop him. If you are an obstacle or defy the path, you're dead weight.<br /><br />Most horror stories focus on the monsters that are made by bug, bird or whatever outbreak the writers decide to develop. This film DOES have monsters and they are man made. The only difference is these monsters know how not to be monsters and still act less human than the things in the dark.<br /><br />John Pata and Adam Bartlett do a superb job of directing and writing with editing that is award worthy. I truly look forward to what these gentlemen will show us next. Joe Belknap does a fantastic job for a first time acting role.  Aaron Christensen, Michelle Courvais and Mary Lindberg give spectacular supporting performances as does the entire cast.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning,  this is a survivor movie.  Surviving the elements, surviving your fellow survivors, surviving exhaustion and ultimately yourself. I recommend DeadWeight as a superb horror drama.",2015-08-31,0.6666666666666666,False,1

He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34; Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film.

I was sad to learn that it was during this production that Miss Tierney (how wonderfully beautiful she was) —it was during this time that she began manifesting deep depression which plagued her most of her life. I thought, how utterly sad; but how wonderful (as I read) that Mr. Bogart was such an understanding and benevolent gentleman, who, when needed, often fed Miss Tierney her lines, as she had great difficulty in some scenes. The acting was somewhat understated, which, to me, made the roles all the more to be cherished an lauded in this day of violence, untoward behavior, and everything seemingly disturbed and evil.. I will watch this movie again, and that is how I know that I appreciate a film. Look at the beautiful Tierney and . . . well, I don't know what else to say, except just to see her made the film worthwhile for me.

Decca Gardner (as Griff) has better days ahead as she grows into her acting ability.<br /><br />Josh Lucas did as much as he could with a limited character of Sherif Curtis, and Damian Lewis as the abusive boyfriend was appropriately malevolent and not too over the top, which is easy to do in that role.

It has a cast led by the amazing and well-chose Robert Carlyle, who pulls the rest of the actors up several levels in their performances.<br />The scripts are more adult and more realistic than the average potboiler, too - simple survival requires much intelligence when faced with almost incomprehensible technology and the terrifying hostile environment of deep space. No easy answers. Every scrap of knowledge requires a step into the unknown. And they don't even know where they are in the universe, let alone how to get home.<br />It's a huge, rich canvas for this skilled creative team. So why did it end early? Not because of flaws in the performances or production structure. It was due to SyFy's usual crappy promotion, and so the series ended long before it was out of story-telling potency.<br />Enjoy what's here. Eli is our Everyman.",2015-08-31,1.0,True,1

I had no idea the particulars of the story when I watched it, other than it was about real life poets and authors. Lucien was a brilliant sociopath and whoever played him did a marvelous job as well.
