      "I was a huge fan of this show!!! It seems a long wait to get them available to purchase and I was happy to buy season 5. However, season 4 does NOT give you the option to purchase the entire season!!!!<br />WHAT GIVES AMAZON?!!!!\n",
      "Very short episodes, but solid\n",
      "I have watched trailers and clips of this and have always had a desire to watch. So I ordered season 1 epi 1.... But it was a lot scarier than I expected.  I was unable to watch ;(. With that I have to say, I'm a Christian and I'm not desensitized like I used to be!!  I love medevil era type movies, but I don't like scary stuff at all!! I've heard awesome reviews from friends I just could not watch myself!!  I'm sure the authors and illustrators are very talented!!!\n",
      "I found this movie boring and unfortunately fell asleep half-way through.\n",
      "Honestly, if it weren't for the lady in the lake, I would recommend this movie to every and five star it in an instant. Absolutely love the creativity and story-telling! Truly a unique film and much worth a watch!\n",
      "loved this show can't wait till season 2 how much longer can we handle, lol.  I would recommend this show\n",
      "Horrible movie\n",
      "Pretty boring, Montage of Heck was much better insight of Nirvana and better made.\n",
      "Very good war show.  Typical Hollywood though in many areas.\n",

      "3 stars mean &#34;it's ok&#34; and that is exactly what this movie is....it's ok. Clearly, it should have been a made for TV movie but regardless, the movie had no real plot and was mostly just character exposition. I did enjoy seeing Mulder and Scully back together again, but the movie should have clearly had a bigger PLOT. I mean, I don't know what the writers were thinking. Why not have something to do with the so-called alien invasion that was supposed to have taken place in 2012? If you're a fan of the X-Files, you should watch it but just note...it's really pretty boring.\n",
      "Bad. So bad. Bad bad bad.\n",
      "If you like sexy Brazilian women with all the curves, you'll probably like this feature. It's so short that it can't be called a full movie, but, who needs to waste time filling in the slow parts with senseless dialogue and plot twists anyway. The lead actress plays a secretary that looks so good, co-workers and bosses can't keep their hands or libidos to themselves as they lose control at the sight of her, in  business surroundings. She walks out of one job after another, fed up with wolf whistles and propositions. She finally gets her revenge in a unique twist ending that adds a glaring hypocrisy to everything she has complained about before. Things end with her in the drivers seat and calling all the shots.\n",
      "Great show!  Really entertaining.  Robson Green and James Norton are a great pair to watch as they work together.  The stories are engaging and all of the acting is terrific.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Pretty good movie. Better if you had watched the shows on HBO. I didn't give it 5 stars because I think it was just lacking something. What? Not really sure, but it left me feeling like I wanted more, maybe that was the plan?\n",

      "OK\n",
      "Fluff piece.  Primary protagonists are likable, but after 3 episodes I'd like to see something of substance developing.  Two people, plus friends, who don't know themselves or each other and respond to every situation with sex and coarse language. Do they have an OFF switch?\n",
      "Way too scary for my six year old. Some kids might not be bothered by it, but my six year old was pleading that we turn it off. I assumed it wouldn't be too scary because of the G rating but then upon researching it further on common sense media's website I see that numerous people have found it to be too scary. Just be aware, nothing like watching a movie before bed time that's going to cause the kids to have night mares all night...\n",
      "After watching this movie, I love Meryl Streep, and my wife knows all about it!<br />I have just recently discovered this extraordinary actor. She deserves her place<br />in Hollywood royalty! This is a great film on several levels.<br />First, that is Meryl Streep singing and playing guitar with a group of L.A.'s<br />best session musicians. She is a believable, and wonderful, musician.<br />Second, her acting is beautiful.<br />Third, the story is a good one.<br />Everything comes together to make this the best film I have seen in a long time.\n",
      "Stupid and vapid.  Dispenses left-wing propaganda and talking points unchallenged.  Jeff Daniels not believable as a news reader.  Characters air out their personal lives in front of everyone in the newsroom.  Does not attempt to present a realistic portrait of a news operation.\n",
      "Awful, dreadful & and overall, shockingly bad!\n",
      "Olympia Dukakis and Babatunde from TV on the Radio are both awesome in this, and by themselves make this movie a refreshing dose of humanity's hilarity and genius.  Schwartzman - dare I say the new Tom Cruise?\n",
      "I re-watched Veronica Mars from Episode 1 to the end and then the movie.  What a wonderful series it still is. It has held up well.  Its worth the timetpsit and watch binge style  Make some popcorn, grab your favorite beverage-and settle in for well written stories, great characters and a talented cast of characters with great southern california locations.  This round of watching it I realized all the subtle puns and movie references that were laced in the script -made it more fun. Good watch ---go for it.\n",
      "Good but not great...too slow and not enough of his artwork was shown\n",
      "This is a series that demands concentration, No action, no sex, just interesting, thoughtful dialog\n",
      "Watched this movie many times over the years. Definitely one the better movies in the Eastwood canon. Malkovich plays the villain superbly.<br />Lots and lots of great character actors fill support roles that just make this movie good.\n",
      "The script was three rewrites from being passable.\n",
      "First, I have always been a big U.N.C.L.E. fan all my life from the very first episode which was aired on September 21, 1964.  I was only 9 years old at the time but &#34;the man from U.N.C.L.E&#34; left a lifelong impression on me.  It's one of the driving reasons I went into Law Enforcement.  I collected anything and everything that was U.N.C.L.E related and still have that collection today!<br /><br />So, with all this in mind, here is my take on the movie: If one is expecting to see the show with hopes of re-experiencing our two favorite agents entering the secret entrance to the New York HQ via Del Floria's Tailor Shop you are going to be disappointed!  Because this is NOT the premise of the movie.<br /><br />However, for all the fans that can get into the idea of seeing a prequel on how, Illya Kuryakin, Napoleon Solo and Alexander Waverly first meet (and getting to know a lot more about all their backgrounds); then you are in for a treat!  The movie does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of life in the early 1960’s and set stage for a great spy thriller of two agents (one CIA and the other KGB) being forced to work together to prevent an international criminal organization from using a Nuclear bomb to instigate a world crisis. While THURSH is never mentioned by name; we all know who is behind this!<br /><br />The movie is fast paced, full of car chases, plot twists, intrigue, plot twists and even double twists to keep the most avid spy and mystery lover guessing all the way through the end of movie!  You can take nothing for granted and many things and people are not what they seem!  For hardcore U.N.C.L.E. fans your will get to see our beloved “U.N.C.L.E Carbine Special” faithfully reproduced make an appearance in several of the big battle scenes near the end of the movie!<br /><br />Bottom line this is a classic spy/action thriller!  With lots of classic U.N.C.L.E humor thrown in to break the mood when thing get a little too intense!  No spoilers here so you will have to see the nail biting end for yourselves; but it is worth the manicure to get there!!\n",
      "Great movie! Love the ending! Knees deep arms SPAGHETTI!!!\n",
      "Very disappointed in the slow, anemic pacing of first two episodes. Too much unnecessary exposition, mostly uninteresting characters and a serious lack of action or scares.\n",
      "Every middle school child should view these excellently written and produced series of cyber bullying and the horrific effects they have on people in general.  I wish the series had been available when I taught school because I think that every one of my students, even the ones who would never bully, would benefit from the content of this series.  Bravo to the producers for creating such an important series of videos.\n",
      "the translation were slow and ineffective and took too much away from viewabliity\n",
      "Really enjoyed the movie. This person's opinion.\n",
      "Entertaining, well done, but it is hard to end such movies in a satisfying realistic way.\n",
      "I have watched this movie as a teenager and wanted to show it to my wife and our 6-year old boy. The movie contained an off-putting amount of bad language (with adults, as well as kids, using words like &#34;s--t,&#34; etc!), meanness and kids screaming at each other, racial stereotypes, etc. Our son was quite scared of the evil crooks, a dead body found by the kids in the walk-in freezer, and the screaming person chained to a chair in the basement. After giving the movie ~25 minutes' chance, we unanimously decided to turn it off. Perhaps we'll try again in a few years, but even for adults this was hard to watch!...<br /><br />We love the beautiful Astoria, OR. Hated the movie.\n",
      "Loved it! Well acted and a great message.\n",
      "That was 2 hours of my life I wish I had back, not to mention the $21.64 I paid Amazon.  What was I expecting?  This was horrible!\n",
      "I got this as a birthday present when it first came out, but it was on tape.  When I saw that it was on Amazon, I had to watch it again.  Love that little piggy.\n",
      "It's like a dacu-drama for the mob.\n",
      "Why is this even a thing? I wish this was someone just wanting to advance a cause instead of someone wanting to outshock his daughters\n",
      "I was most pleasantly surprised.  I was led to believe that it was mainly a historical movie about my hometown, Albany, NY.  It was filmaed in  here, but it was a story of what people went through during that time, anywhere.  It is a great movie and worth watching.\n",
      "Good stuff.  Funny.\n",
      "I enjoyed this, but it was not what I expected from the title.  I assume &#34;Murder&#34; is a quantity not a crime.  I spend the first couple of minute &#34;Saying, what the&#34;. This is a low budget film about the producer's friends and co workers, who are bicycle couriers.  So it is a little slice of life film, I hope the producer finds another venture.\n",
      "This was not as good as I hoped\n",
      "A warm , sweet, inspiring story.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "I though the show was stupid. I only watched episode 1. It was an hour of my life I'll never get back.\n",
      "just purchase this and I just cant get enough of the Templars zombies it creepy to watch them move so slowly however they do manage to get their target every single time!!! more more please!!!!!\n",
      "This is really funny and clever... assuming you think three word sentences, one word of which is f...k, passes for writing. They should give me five stars for attempting to watch this. Actually, I'd rather have the 15 minutes I wasted on this, back.<br /><br />Too bad, I've seen Jack Black do some decent work.\n",
      "Fantastic Movie.  I cannot get enough of Kim Woo-Bin.  To see him act his age in this movie and say and do thing a grown man would say and do his age was a complete turn on.  I just wish I  could purchase Friend I.\n",
      "Interesting to me for I volunteer at a nursing home. I can see a couple of the residents there wishing they could do what the lady in this movie did. It, also, showed us that families should be more concerned for one another and to be careful what you say. There was laughter and sadness as I watched this movie.\n",
      "Fell asleep.\n",
      "The streaming was interrupted many times during the movie. Key lines were left out. Your interruptions ruined the movie we were trying to see.\n",
      "Loved it!\n",
      "Excellent Drama.  I was hooked after the first episode!  Each episode drew me deeper and deeper into the story.  There are so many great story lines and twists and turns.  I wish there were more than 2 seasons to watch!!\n",
      "absolutely enjoyed it even though I had watched it once before\n",
      "Fun horror.  The best kind, in that you are scared but feel okay because of the laughter and the whole not taking demonic forces too seriously.  I think the end could have had more of a punch than just the gotcha,  because of the most horrible part of the film....The catacombs...were underuitilized. But still,  the film is a lot of fun and Dark Vision 2, The Darker Vision, will be even more fun!\n",
      "Wish I could give it a half star.\n",
      "Looking forward to more...but it sure seems there are a lot of &#34;life after prison&#34; shows out now...time for something original.\n",
      "Excellent preview of the second season\n",
      "The sreen size kept changing we could not watch it as half the picture went off screen.  Going to rent it elsewhere\n",
      "Great movie. Social concerns addressed about dying with dignity\n",
      "Not worth the money. Too much talking for little kids\n",
      "Love Ray.  He has a style that is more home town.\n",
      "I've always loved movies and T.V. shows about immortals like Highlander so I absolutely loved this flick. Except it's even better because it's a romance which is a nice twist. I liked seeing a young Harrison Ford and at first kinda felt sorry for the Adeline because she can no longer seem  to find love. The best line of the movie is 'he was a young Bing Crosby..type.' And when Adeline showed that she had a strong knowledge of baseball knowing that Ted Williams nickname was 'the thumper,' and even knew his life time batting average I was in love with her . Anyway with out ruing the movie I was glad to find she did eventually find true love. This is also a movie that would have made a great novel.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "This is a very important movie, especially if you love animals and cats. I am going to send it to my vet in effort to get her to stop declawing.\n",
      "I like the movie very much but it was more of a love story it surprised me . Richard Gere was wonderful as always. But the fact mental illness was not what I expected it to believe I guess that's why I was wondering about the ones that were it surprised me not ķnowing what to expect. The movie was amazing greater when I understood it. Thank you.\n",
      "If you are a Viking reenactor or enthusiast I have some advice for you, do not waste your time or money. This film is a complete joke! Within 5 minutes I knew I had made a mistake renting it.  The story line is predictable and boring. The costumes are completely fantasy based, and dont resemble anything even near to the time period potrayed. Everyone involved in this film needs to reevaluate what their goals are in the entertainment business and start over!\n",
      "Very solid acting performances throughout!\n",
      "There is a reason for editing a movie.  I enjoyed the book of The Outsiders and realize that when a movie is made, changes sometimes happen to tighten the story.  This cut features extra footage, none of which enhances the movie.  Music has been added to quiet reflective moments, overpowering the dialogue.  Some scenes were even replaced with different takes than those included in the theatrical release.  The film quality is also poor.  Horrible.\n",
      "This is a great performance presented with high production values.  If you only have the band's first five albums (!!!) as I do, there will be several songs that you won't recognize.  Scott Gorham and Michael Schenker appear as guests and are awesome.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "Oh my goodness. It's like the writer/director/whatever for this piece of trash spent 10 minutes on the Internet--and 5 on /b/ before crapping out this script. Little to no understanding of anything of the Internet culture--spouting memes completely out-of-context with dialogue that is stilted and unnatural, boring characters and hiring Youtube 'celebrities'? Really? Please, skip this one.\n",
      "I binge-watched The Red Road.  TRR is a show on Sundance TV.<br /><br />Well, it was a show….<br /><br />I watched the first and second season in two days, hopped on the web to find out when season three starts, and was quickly cut off at the knees as I found out the show had been cancelled ON A CLIFFHANGER!  Why, Sundance???  WHY?????<br /><br />If you’re willing to deal with the emotional sinkhole that is the final episode/season two finale, I highly recommend The Red Road.  I was so excited when watching it because it’s a fantastic show with a stellar cast, and Jason Momoa is a key component.  His character is one of those guys who flirts with the line between a Good Bad Guy and a Bad Good Guy and Momoa sells it.  Hard.  There are a few moments in TRR where he is broken, there are moments when he’s content, and there are moments when he’s flat-out scary.  I loved it.  He deserves awards for his performance.  Particularly the season two finale....\n",
      "movie for 15 year olds. Actors can't act and plot if routine and mundane.\n",
      "Great movie.  Rapace is quite good, very convincing as a worried mother, very expressive actress.  I suspected something else was going on about halfway through the movie but it took near the end for me to figure it out.  I'm left with questions regarding the school director--that one was unexplained unless I missed something.  Also open ended ? about the salesman who helps her pick out the baby monitor.  Why did he see that boy? What was his relationship with his own mother?  I have my suspicions but I'll have to watch it again, see if maybe I missed the closure of those 2 items.<br /><br />Well worth watching.\n",
      "The only gripe I have about this movie.Is the cover of the DVD.Its totally misleading people.? Yes, the movie is old and foreign.The original title is' The Vampire People'.I think it might be Spanish or some Mexican.?I don't no which but still a great movie!🌟🌟🌟\n",
      "SPOILER (this is the opening scene):<br /><br />The camera pans up and across the crest of a small rise.  The smoking and burning silhouettes of tanks cover a debris-ridden battlefield, including a couple of Panther tanks.  A Sherman tank sits amongst the wreckage.  All is quiet.  Into this scene rides some German (officer?) on a white horse leisurely clip clopping along.  &#34;Do-dee-do-dee-do, just out for a morning ride.  Good thing we must have cleared this battlefield and pushed the Americans way back so I can just plod along here with no real purpose or concern.  Nothing to worry about here.&#34;  &#34;Iii-eeeee!!!!&#34;  From out of the shadows of the top of the Sherman, a wild man vaults onto the horseman, propels them both to the ground, and then stabs the horseman deep into the eye as the camera goes in for a closeup.  After pulling his knife out, we see the ambusher is none other than Brad Pitt.  He mumbles some stuff, pats the horse on the head and then hops back on the Sherman and climbs in.  We quickly discern his tank was disabled in the battle and the crew is hiding inside trying to get it fixed.  Good thing Brad took care of the only person on either side curious about how the battle came out or these guys might be in a world of trouble.<br /><br />A few war crimes presented as standard operating procedure, some more odd events, and multiple f-bombs later, we get to an improbable battle at the end and we're done - bringing it all artistically together by showing a white horse again.\n",
      "Old Fashioned is a Christian romance movie all about chivalry. I have to say that this movie had good morals. However, there wasn't much of a plot and the movie moved really slow.\n",
      "I love Rare Exports and was really anticipating this follow-up. Was not disappointed. Really fun movie and so offbeat.\n",
      "good light entertainment with a refreshing twist... a beautiful woman who respects herself enough to set the moral bar high and her boundaries strong.  She gives this man a chance to value her at her worth.\n",

      "Dan Mercer (Ben Rosenfield) and Melanie Clark (Taissa Farmiga) are in their last year of college and getting ready to go out into the real world. Dan is working as an intern for a record label and has their eye. Mel appears to be on her way to be an elementary school teacher at their home in Austin, Texas. Dan and Melanie have been together for 6 years. Melanie has become extremely co-dependent. She likes to drink, but is not good at it. Dan doesn't like her friends, and Melanie doesn't like Dan's work friends. Their relationship is at a crossroads where they can't live with each other, but can't live apart.<br /><br />After the 20 minute introduction of characters and the set up, the film started to slow up. There are some slow scenes. You have to ask, &quot;What is their problem?&quot; and then you remember what it was like to be that age. Of course if you are at that age and in that type of relationship, this film could be 5 stars for you. The film was well acted. Taissa nailed it. Good screen chemistry. I just couldn't get into the self imposed drama of their lives.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb, sex, brief Internet nudity.\n",
      "Even Kat Denning's Jovian bust size can't save this mediocre &#34;quriky horror comedy.&#34; I put those words in quotations because this film wishes it was really a quirky horror comedy, rather than the mess of utter lameness it is. Its attempts at being clever fall flat, as it desperately clings onto the annoying indie comedy tropes that make the genre insufferable rather than ingenious comedy.<br /><br />If you want a funny horror comedy, go watch Odd Thomas, cause I'm sure the makers of this film certainly liked both the book and the film.\n",
      "Semi-interesting movie but the abrupt ending or lack of an ending period made it awful.\n",
      "It may be an award winner but I guess I just don't like Woody Allen.\n",
      "What an exciting season!  All of the family members love it.  Best season ever!!\n",
      "This was a beautifully done movie. The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful and is as much a focus of the movie as the relationship between Sebastian and Belle. The background music is also very good. The one thing that detracts very much from the experience is the dubbed voices. My husband commented that the voices were &#34;too American&#34;. While I know that children might have difficulties reading subtitles, the voice-overs could have had the appropriate accents, which children do not have a problem with. I would love to have the option of watching it with subtitles.\n",
      "I was very disappointing in this show. I LOVE Matthew McConaughey and was so excited when I found out he was going to be in a TV series. I didn't even finish the series. The series was dry and there wasn't a single episode that left me with that &#34;what's going to happen next?!&#34; feeling, despite it being a crime/drama genre.\n",
      "excellent series.  we completely enjoy it\n",
      "Fantastic story, wonderful acting. We LOVED this movie!\n",
      "Not quite as good as the first Exotic Marigold Hotel.\n",
      "Fantastic powerful movie!  I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Excellent movie\n",
      "The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967.  They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.  Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.\n",
      "I don't care for Trevor Noah.  I think most of his comedy is sophomoric observances of American culture and language.  While it's acceptable coming from Jon Stewart, hearing the same criticisms from someone from South Africa is a wholly different matter.\n",
      "I can only imagine that Kate Winslet was begging the screen writers, &#34;Please.  For all that is holy.  Kill me in this movie.  Don't make me come back for the third film.&#34;\n",
      "Not impressed. $2.89 gas in LA....really\n",
      "Rog is annoying.  There was so many times that I wished that I could throttle him for his chauvinistic behavior and just being a douche. The main guy...I think his name is Tim or something, he was a jerk and annoying as well. His acting was not believable at all and seemed forced.  The only characters that I liked were Harold, Chad and Julie.  This movie could have been better, but they didn't care to make it better.  The end scene didn't make much sense.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to be annoyed.  It just proves that there aren't any truly scary movies anymore.\n",
      "I can't believe I wasted over 2 hours on this garbage. This will give me nightmares, not because it's scary, but because it is so horribly written and the acting is sub-par at best. Marcia Gay Harden's character is an absolute lunatic, but the so-called &#34;hero&#34; of the movie is even worse. Half the time he has no idea what he's doing and the other half he makes brain-dead decisions (do a search for ending spoilers if you really want to know more). I'm not sure how much different this is from the book, but if it's even close to similar Stephen King can suck it on this one. Honestly, I was having a good day until I mistakenly chose to view this waste of film.\n",
      "I may change my review as the season progresses, but so far this is a lame excuse for a Walking Dead prequel. Where are the vibrant characters and story lines I have come to love from the WD writers?  These people are uninteresting and flat and dumb. By episode 2, I don't care about them at all. I was hoping for a more global view of the initial spread of the virus, but instead I am stuck following a dysfunctional family and an addict - both of which are totally stupid.  BOO.... yet.....I am compelled to watch the next episode even though I have found myself completely disappointed thus far. I am trying to find hope in what seems like a hopeless set of characters I hope will die so we can get on with some new people.<br /><br />WD writers - what were you thinking?????\n",
      "Story was boring. No plot. No drama. In fact no acting. It's a waste of time.\n",
      "The individual episodes can vary in quality but I like the premise and some shows are very good. Sometimes I would like to see other branches of a family tree pursued as well as the primary focus of the show. Worth a sequel maybe?\n",
      "Too dark<br />Too loud<br />Too atmospheric<br />Too bad because the first two seasons were superb. And season three ends just as we get to the Buffalo Bill story.<br />I'm disappointed we'll never see that segment. I think we would have if the didn't go over the top in season three.\n",
      "The acting is atrocious. The diologue is even worse!<br /><br />I never knew that a movie that showed so much boob and sex could bore me so much!\n",
      "Great characters, timely stories, a little disturbing but very engaging. We love all of the main characters.<br /><br />We watched Season 2 on network (which just finished) but wanted to re-watch early episodes to see it full circle. The story moves fast and alot goes on, so it was well worth watching again!  P.S. The early episodes weren't on demand through our cable service so we were happy to watch on Amazon.  Thanks.\n",
      "If you like Pierce Brosnan, then you'll like this film.  Predictable but entertaining.\n",
      "Great premise. Would like to see more episodes\n",
      "Outstanding love the show\n",
      "Run of the mill storyline.\n",
      "had to shut it off after 20 minutes, because it was just going nowhere and making no sense to me...\n",
      "A delightful way to learn about Australia. I especially enjoyed seeing some of the lesser known areas and different ways of cooking.\n",
      "short, informative, and nice breasts.\n",
      "&#34;...This is the best thing to wear for today, you understand. Because I don't like women in skirts and the best thing is to wear pantyhose or some pants under a short skirt, I think. Then you have the pants under the skirt and then you can pull the stockings up over the pants underneath the skirt. And you can always take off the skirt and use it as a cape. So I think this is the best costume for today.&#34;\n",
      "A smart poverty row film. Great to watch on a rainy day.\n",
      "Didn't finish watching it - Didn't like it at all.\n",
      "Love Tom Selic all the cast is great and the story line beleavable , can't wait for the fall season to begin\n",
      "So so\n",
      "This is not the actual movie, so unless you just want previews of all the best parts. Dont bother. I realize now that it was behind the scenes, but it bored me to tears. Only watched the first 1/4.\n",
      "Apparently for anyone who has worked on a reality TV show, as the creator has, this show has unparalleled authenticity.  Shiri Appleby and Constance Zimmer have fabulous chemistry for their dysfunctional, effective partnership.  Don't know how this show ended up on Lifetime, but it's to Lifetime what Breaking Bad was to AMC.\n",
      "It's an all around wonderful sisterly love movie\n",
      "Tortuously slow and nonsensical; mention of &#34;Schroeder's Cat&#34; and palaver about other theoretical physics terminology does not amount to &#34;science&#34;. This is silly science-fiction delivered as drawn out melodrama which is simply not entertaining. The minimal amount of weak &#34;special effects&#34; amount to no more that computer screen graphics displays, oscillating lights, fading in & out and vanishing. Whoop-dee-doo. Decent acting and mildly satisfying closure to the feeble premise keep this from getting a 1-star rating.\n",
      "we were disappointed. for such a dynamic man, this documentary was NOT!\n",
      "This movie races along trying to get every page in the script giving little time for the actors to act or for the audience to understand.\n",
      "Of the BEST series I've seen ! !\n",
      "Highly anticipated viewing this movie and was more then a bit dissapointed. Movie never really got going...was anticipating much more action given advertising. Ending was odd as well.\n",
      "3 and 5 year old like this have played it several times:)\n",
      "to much blood. and killing.\n",
      "This documentary is so focused on fast talk that it fails to consider any other aspect of competitive college debate - such as the quality and nature of the arguments advanced, the controversy over discussions of race, the application of academic theories about communication (post-modernism, post-structuralism, deconstructionism, other &#34;isms&#34;), etc. The obsession with the strangeness of watching debaters who talk fast misses what is most valuable about college debate, namely that it teaches kids the research and critical thinking skills to engage with complicated and abstract ideas, as well as what actually threatens to undercut these valuable lessons. Ms. Tolchinsky does not seem to understand the arguments in and about competitive debate, so she returns again and again to the not-particularly-important question of whether the debaters are talking too fast. College debate has its weaknesses, but I don't think fast talk is one of them.\n",
      "A TV classic. Of course, a bit dated and predictable. A nostalgia watch.\n",
      "Not exceptional.\n"
