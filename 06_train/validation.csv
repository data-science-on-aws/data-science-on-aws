It asks 'if then'? What if socialists win elections across the globe? What if Donald Trump wins in 2016, and is such an amazing leader, him and his brand of leadership serve as a guide for our nation, or perhaps the world, for generations to come? Just as often as it asks, 'if then', it asks, 'what if'? What if energy becomes completely free? What if cloning humans becomes as prevalent a trip to the local doctor? Many might recognize Sci Fi in it's creation of imaginary worlds that ask us to look upon our own world right now, presented in a different perspective, sometimes criticizing current society, or instead, some members in it.<br /><br />There were early or proto 'sci-fi' stories written as long ago as 2,000 years ago but it's been said science fiction as we know it didn't really (and couldn't really) exist until the 1900's when we became more aware of the larger world around us. It's a menace, a threat, a disease, or an ideology that threatens us all. After watching Battleship, I can't help but wonder if characters in the story have to save the whole world in order for it to Science fiction.<br /><br />Do the characters in Battleship save the world? With the speed in which aliens send five space ships to Earth after receiving a radio message from Earth, covering at bare minimum 10 light years distance, and their amazing ability to put up an energy shield covering all of Hawaii and a larger portion of ocean, it is a real question as to whether or not they'd send even more ships? The mystery of their other ships disappearance might mean something to them. Perhaps, though, for whatever reason, our navies did save the Earth.<br /><br />There's some question throughout the film whether or not the aliens are truly hostile, or whether they are merely trying to protect themselves and their mission as the film unwinds (although admittedly over reacting to us Earthlings - or did they under react to the threat we pose)?Quite often they let Earthlings go or be on their way if they do not consider them a threat. Are they going to eliminate or subjugate them later? Who knows, but why take any chances? One of the more interesting scenes in the film is shown from the perspective of one of the alien soldiers. It seems to be a memory or a flashback. We see him and his race at war with and being attacked by another alien race.<br /><br />The escalation to war, or at least fighting, is held out to be a metaphor for a fight between an American navy captain (the lead in the film) and his Korean rival. Our navy captain is punished quite severely for participating in the fight. It's an open question in the mind of the viewer through much of the film - is he being punished so hard because his opponent is Korean, or Asian? Throughout the film, especially the later parts, I couldn't help but see pop singer Rihanna, the female lead, in the role of mate to many of the different male characters (especially the extra pale guy with the buzz cut that often behaved kind of stupidly). The 'shells' being loaded and fired became quite interesting. I don't know what it was. It was a very intense movie. We can always hope they achieve contact. Battleship couldn't have been made without an interracial cast. Or at least it wouldn't have been as interesting - having only the action on screen to interest us.<br /><br />Overall it was a very entertaining film. Overall the plot made a lot of sense. Our victory over much more powerful aliens made a bit less sense. There were some breaks in the action, or explanations that went missing in the film (at what point did night fall and the Aliens somehow lose track of them)?  Battleship may have been cut or reduced in length. If so the film suffered a little bit because of it. Over all the film makes more sense if you consider that the aliens might not be completely hostile, or again, if they don't see us as much of an immediate threat to their selfish plans.<br /><br />One thing is certain, never send out a signal to another planet deep in space we know nothing about in order to contact them.

There are inevitable comparisons to an original hit that make it tough for spin-off series, but in this case it seems like the production powers that be are the ones guilty of tying the show to the background knowledge of an experienced fan following rather than creating a solid vehicle that can stand on its own. That Fear the Walking Dead is a pale reflection of the original isn't the problem; it's just bad television! They go to the trouble of setting up this blended family story in episode 1, an unsubtle device used primarily to populate a multi-ethnic cast. That breaks down by episode 2, when the writers resort to a stereotype-driven story that divides the core characters and LA landscape in two--the violent, urban, Spanish-speaking inner city of looters and a nice, polite, white suburban neighborhood, where birthday parties come with a blow-up moon bounce even as the Apocalypse approaches. Despite the growling zombies and wailing sirens signaling civilization's fall, you can hear the main characters and minor victims all screaming &#34;youth demographic!!!&#34; The parents/kids-just-don't-understand bit repeats with every one of the too-many teens in the show--largely of the obnoxious variety. That includes the druggie black sheep Nick, the only actor in the cast of the living that seems to have a pulse, and Frank Dillane certainly turns in an energetic performance. He seems to have talent, so I presume it's the stinker of a script and direction responsible for a characterization that seems less starring role and more bad acting class exercise. You can almost hear a teacher giving the assignment to develop a Jekyll and Hyde-style mash-up of Jack Sparrow and the Mad Hatter as a drug addict. The only actual character that engaged my attention at all was the quiet, doughy Tobias, the geekster wizard who has seen the horrible future coming while spending too many overnight hours online, but even there the writers miss the mark. There's no way a kid like that would decide to trade a locked room and laptop for the &#34;safety&#34; of large numbers of high school peers whose humanity was in question even before zombies attacked! It's true that a certain amount of disbelief has to be suspended for a show like this to work, but there still has to be logic and consistency in the rules that do govern the world being created. Having Tobias come to school to be with more people, come all the way back later because the school was the best place he could think of to find a standard kitchen knife and canned goods, educate his teacher about the new way of the world, and then reject her offer to stay with her group in favor of isolation with a sometimes-around-uncle does NOT make any sense! Yet my preoccupation with that situation illustrates the essential problem with this show. Class, can we say booooooorrrrrriiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggg????? This show can't and shouldn't be the same kind of high-octane thrill that the original Walking Dead set off by having the lead character wake from a coma to join the Apocalypse already in progress. The backstory of those missing months is a natural curiosity guaranteed to draw people into the more intimate aspects of how it all started, but that's not what we're getting. The only thing viewers have to fear here is whether or not their snoring will wake the neighbors.",2015-08-31,0.75,False,0

There's a slight amount of flex possible in the phone but it appears to handle it well.<br /><br />Button placement - Horrible - 1/5 HTC decided, for whatever reason, to put the power button, and the volume buttons on the same side (right side) of the bezel. they are in fairly close proximity to each other, so you will find yourself pressing the power button at times when you are trying to adjust volume. also the placement of the power button itself could not have been in a worse place. It rests about 2/3 of the way up the bezel, which conveniently, (or not so much so) is right where most people grab the phone when in use, thus causing you to constantly, inadvertently press the power button  and subsequently locking your phone in the middle of whatever you were doing. It also causes you to hit the power button while removing your phone from your pocket. ***MAJOR ANNOYANCE***<br /><br />Screen - Decent - 3/5. For a low/mid range device, the screen is adequate. The colors are pretty true, but the blacks look a bit more grey, than a true deep black. not a deal killer unless you are a videophile or just super picky about the black level on your device. it has an ips screen which allows viewing from extreme angles, without the image &#34;washing out&#34; or flipping negative&#34; it has a 720x1280  resolution with 294ppi density (for the nerds). the device has light sensing capability and for the most part, it does a good job keeping the screen view-able in most conditions. it also can get pretty bright if you use the manual back-light settings.<br /><br />Sound - HORRIBLE - 1/5. First off, HTC decided not to add the BOOM SOUND hardware to this device. It appears to have the signature HTC stereo front facing speakers, but in reality, the top speaker grill is only the earpiece speaker. The lower grill houses the loudspeaker which, at its highest setting, is only marginally loud in a quiet setting. and if you work, or happen to be located somewhere where there is background noise, you can pretty much forget the speakerphone, or listening to music without headphones. Consequentially, ringer volume also suffers, and i have had several instances where i have missed calls or notifications because i simply didn't hear the thing ring. Even in my pocket. Aftermarket &#34;super loud&#34; ringtones help a bit, but....<br /><br />Software - HTC Sense 7 UI. Its HTC Sense. what can you say. the lock screen sucks. its not customizable with widgets or anything useful. it comes with a big basic clock with weather, and the basic dock icons at the bottom which allows you to choose what function you want to unlock into. ie, phone contacts messages internet, and there aren't any options to modify this configuration that i have located as of this posting. also the pattern (9 dots) is quite small compared to the available screen space making it more likely to make an error while inputting your security pattern code.<br /><br />vibration - 2/5 - Weak at best. could miss it, even in your pocket.<br /><br />STORAGE - Marginal / low - 2/5. The device touts 8 gig of storage, but alas, after the OS and bloatware go on, the end user is left with somewhere around 3.75 gigs of space to play with. For a sub $100 device, it could be considered acceptable, but there really needs to be something done with manufacturers misrepresenting ROM, as if the advertised space is truly whats available to the end-user. Supposedly, the new Lollipop version of android includes the capability to WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, but using the latest ES file explorer, i still have difficulty writing files and creating folders on the external sd. But thats not the manufacturers fault its Android. but it needed to be said. Get an external card adapter if you want to add your music or movie collection to the sd card, as i have attempted to lan transfer files to the ext sd, and some larger files ended up corrupted, or disappeared altogether after a reboot.<br /><br />Processor speed - 3/5. Again This is a sub $100 device but the decision to include a Snapdragon 210, instead of a SD410 baffles me. the device experiences some lag switching between apps, unlocking, and pretty much any type of multitasking events attempted. it doesn't totally kill the experience, but if you are used to snappy switching between apps, you will notice the lag time. Playing a full 1080p trailer from internal memory resulted in a slightly choppy, but not unwatchable video.<br /><br />Calls - 4/5 Haven't really had any complaints making and receiving calls using the handset, although i have heard that the speakerphone function sounds muffled at times<br /><br />Cameras. Fairly decent. with the HDR mode, you can get some pretty clear pics. the included picture was taken at dusk, with no flash, in HDR mode. Video appears to be of a decent quality, and there is a rear facing mic to capture sound<br /><br />Durability. ?/5 - it has been dropped, several times. A couple times on corners, and with the exception of a minor ding or 2, the device seems to be<br />none the worse. Not sure what material the screen is made of but it seems to scratch fairly easy, as i have a slight scratch or two that i still dont know where they came from. (not from dropping it) possibly something in my pocket, but my device always has its own pocket, so i don't know. only time will tell how well this device holds up to the rigors of a rough and tumble environment. And i purchased the white one specifically so i could see what surface wear was occurring, and how being handled with oily hands and being in a dusty shop affects the outer shell<br /><br />Battery Life - 3/5 - The device ships with a NON-REMOVABLE 2000mah battery which in my opinion, is too small of a battery to be in a device with a 5 inch screen. leaving the screen on and/ or using high brightness mode, you can practically watch the battery level go down. with moderate usage, you can make it through the day without having to charge, but if you do a lot of social media or watching videos, you might want to keep a charger handy. on another note, the device charges fairly quickly, so the trade off is marginal, IF you have a charger with you. there is also a power saving mode, and an extreme power saving mode that turns off almost all the advanced functions, leaving only basic functionality, but greatly extends your battery life. In an emergency, it could be the difference between a dead phone, and still having basic communication.<br /><br />Bluetooth. - 4/5 - paired to my bluetooth helmet fairly easily. plays music and takes phone calls. The volume was lower than my previous device in the helmet speakers.<br /><br />Wifi. -5/5 connected and held the connection for a decent distance away from the router. haven't had any issues with disconnects or authentication problems.<br /><br />Sim Card and Micro sd card slots are located on the left edge, under a plastic door. the device supposedly supports up to 200 gig of sd expansion, although i have never seen a 200gb micro sd card.<br /><br />Root - ? - As of this posting, there isn't any publicly known method to root this device.<br /><br />Overall - 3/5 - This device is more suited for a casual user, that wants smartphone capability. The basic functions operate well enough. but if you want or need a snappy response or you are a power user, this device may not be for you. Dont get this device confused with the HTC 626, which specs out at 16gigs of onboard memory and has an 8Mp camera insteadof a 5Mp and has the SD410 chip versus the SD210.",2015-08-31,0.9,True,0

I felt like the writer and director purposely misled the audience to try to be clever and throw us a curve, but it just didn't work.<br /><br />However, I do give props for good cinematography, which lent to a few genuinely creepy and disturbing moments. The actors are fine and do the best they can with the material they're given, but holy crap, was the ending cheesy as hell.<br /><br />I wish I could recommend this to those who enjoy more of a slasher type film, but I'm afraid that audience might get bored by the execution, so to speak.

Elisabeth Moss is absolutely mesmerizing in this film and at this moment is my choice for Best Lead Actress. The slow mental breakdown that Catherine is going through is rather chilling and Moss’s facial expressions alone tell a lot of the story.

I was only 9 years old at the time but &#34;the man from U.N.C.L.E&#34; left a lifelong impression on me.  It's one of the driving reasons I went into Law Enforcement.  I collected anything and everything that was U.N.C.L.E related and still have that collection today!<br /><br />So, with all this in mind, here is my take on the movie: If one is expecting to see the show with hopes of re-experiencing our two favorite agents entering the secret entrance to the New York HQ via Del Floria's Tailor Shop you are going to be disappointed!  Because this is NOT the premise of the movie.<br /><br />However, for all the fans that can get into the idea of seeing a prequel on how, Illya Kuryakin, Napoleon Solo and Alexander Waverly first meet (and getting to know a lot more about all their backgrounds); then you are in for a treat!  The movie does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of life in the early 1960’s and set stage for a great spy thriller of two agents (one CIA and the other KGB) being forced to work together to prevent an international criminal organization from using a Nuclear bomb to instigate a world crisis. While THURSH is never mentioned by name; we all know who is behind this!<br /><br />The movie is fast paced, full of car chases, plot twists, intrigue, plot twists and even double twists to keep the most avid spy and mystery lover guessing all the way through the end of movie!  You can take nothing for granted and many things and people are not what they seem!  For hardcore U.N.C.L.E. fans your will get to see our beloved “U.N.C.L.E Carbine Special” faithfully reproduced make an appearance in several of the big battle scenes near the end of the movie!<br /><br />Bottom line this is a classic spy/action thriller!  With lots of classic U.N.C.L.E humor thrown in to break the mood when thing get a little too intense!

I am surprised at the title in relation to the movie.",This was very hard to follow and was very difficult to understand what they were getting at in this movie. The title is very deceiving and not truly what you can think it is.<br />I don't know what to expect from other episodes and don't know if I want to see other episodes after watching the premier of this movie. Its very difficult to really tell the quality of the movie because it seemed to be all over the place with what it was trying to convey.

This was a combination of Ole Yella meets Betty Ford !  This is one more attempt from Hollywood to make us think that odd balls of society are the ruling factor.  A woman who has been widowed and retired for 20 years and drinks her lunch- decides to start smoking pot out of boredom and hasn't been out at night in 2 decades  is not something we need to aspire to !!!! Its a sad case of one wasting a life and not something that deserves a movie.  As far as the Director of this depression feast - are they truly getting that lazy that they no longer attempt a sound track or any form of background setting and the dinner scene was almost laughable !! ?? This is so dull and quite it is like watch a bad reality show ........ so the message is .....once your husband dies you hunker in the house with a case a wine?? NICE MESSAGE !  I would call this a case of &#34; A Conscious Uncoupling Of Talent&#34; !!!!,2015-08-31,0.7804878048780488,True,0
