    "\n",
    "For the most part, the algorithms in Amazon Personalize (called recipes) look to solve different tasks, explained here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Personalization** - New release that supports ALL HRNN workflows / user personalization needs, it will be what we use here.\n",
    "1. **HRNN & HRNN-Metadata** - Recommends items based on previous user interactions with items.\n",
    "1. **HRNN-Coldstart** - Recommends new items for which interaction data is not yet available.\n",
    "1. **Personalized-Ranking** - Takes a collection of items and then orders them in probable order of interest using an HRNN-like approach.\n",
    "1. **SIMS (Similar Items)** - Given one item, recommends other items also interacted with by users.\n",
    "1. **Popularity-Count** - Recommends the most popular items, if HRNN or HRNN-Metadata do not have an answer - this is returned by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter the use case, the algorithms all share a base of learning on user-item-interaction data which is defined by 3 core attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UserID** - The user who interacted\n",
    "1. **ItemID** - The item the user interacted with\n",
    "1. **Timestamp** - The time at which the interaction occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "We also support event types and event values defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Type** - Categorical label of an event (browse, purchased, rated, etc).\n",
    "1. **Event Value** - A value corresponding to the event type that occurred. Generally speaking, we look for normalized values between 0 and 1 over the event types. For example, if there are three phases to complete a transaction (clicked, added-to-cart, and purchased), then there would be an event_value for each phase as 0.33, 0.66, and 1.0 respectfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "The event type and event value fields are additional data which can be used to filter the data sent for training the personalization model. In this particular exercise we will not have an event type or event value. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Choose a dataset or data source <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"source\"></a>\n",
    "[Back to top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned, the user-item-iteraction data is key for getting started with the service. This means we need to look for use cases that generate that kind of data, a few common examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Video-on-demand applications\n",
    "1. E-commerce platforms\n",
    "1. Social media aggregators / platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few guidelines for scoping a problem suitable for Personalize. We recommend the values below as a starting point, although the [official limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/limits.html) lie a little lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Authenticated users\n",
    "* At least 50 unique users\n",
    "* At least 100 unique items\n",
    "* At least 2 dozen interactions for each user \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time this is easily attainable, and if you are low in one category, you can often make up for it by having a larger number in another category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking your data will not arrive in a perfect form for Personalize, and will take some modification to be structured correctly. This notebook looks to guide you through all of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we are going to use the latest MovieLens dataset, this dataset has over 25 million interactions and a rich collection of metadata for items, there is also a smaller version of this dataset, which can be used to shorten training times, while still incorporating the same capabilities as the full dataset. Set USE_FULL_MOVIELENS to True to use the full dataset."
